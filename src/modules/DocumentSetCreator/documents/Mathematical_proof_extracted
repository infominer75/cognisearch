Related modern words are the English "probe", "proboscis”, "probation", and "probability", the Spanish "probar" (to smell or taste, or (lesser use) touch or test), #cite_note-2 [3] Italian "provare" (to try), and the German "probieren" (to try). The early use of "probity" was in the presentation of legal evidence. A person of authority, such as a nobleman, was said to have probity, whereby the evidence was by his relative authority, which outweighed empirical testimony. #cite_note-3 [4] Plausibility arguments using heuristic devices such as pictures and analogies preceded strict mathematical proof. #cite_note-Krantz-4 [5] It is probable that the idea of demonstrating a conclusion first arose in connection with /wiki/Geometry Geometry geometry, which originally meant the same as "land measurement". #cite_note-5 [6] The development of mathematical proof is primarily the product of /wiki/Greek_mathematics Greek mathematics ancient Greek mathematics, and one of its greatest achievements. /wiki/Thales Thales Thales (624–546 BCE) proved some theorems in geometry. /wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus Eudoxus of Cnidus Eudoxus (408–355 BCE) and /wiki/Theaetetus_(mathematician) Theaetetus (mathematician) Theaetetus (417–369 BCE) formulated theorems but did not prove them. /wiki/Aristotle Aristotle Aristotle (384–322 BCE) said definitions should describe the concept being defined in terms of other concepts already known. Mathematical proofs were revolutionized by /wiki/Euclid Euclid Euclid (300 BCE), who introduced the /wiki/Axiomatic_method Axiomatic method axiomatic method still in use today, starting with /wiki/Undefined_term Undefined term undefined terms and /wiki/Axioms Axioms axioms (propositions regarding the undefined terms assumed to be self-evidently true from the Greek “axios” meaning “something worthy”), and used these to prove theorems using /wiki/Deductive_logic Deductive logic deductive logic. His book, the /wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements Euclid's Elements Elements, was read by anyone who was considered educated in the West until the middle of the 20th century. #cite_note-6 [7] In addition to the familiar theorems of geometry, such as the /wiki/Pythagorean_theorem Pythagorean theorem Pythagorean theorem, the Elements includes a proof that the square root of two is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Further advances took place in /wiki/Mathematics_in_medieval_Islam Mathematics in medieval Islam medieval Islamic mathematics. While earlier Greek proofs were largely geometric demonstrations, the development of /wiki/Arithmetic Arithmetic arithmetic and /wiki/Algebra Algebra algebra by Islamic mathematicians allowed more general proofs that no longer depended on geometry. In the 10th century CE, the /wiki/Iraqi_people Iraqi people Iraqi mathematician Al-Hashimi provided general proofs for numbers (rather than geometric demonstrations) as he considered multiplication, division, etc. for ”lines.” He used this method to provide a proof of the existence of /wiki/Irrational_number Irrational number irrational numbers. #cite_note-7 [8] An /wiki/Mathematical_induction Mathematical induction inductive proof for /wiki/Arithmetic_progression Arithmetic progression arithmetic sequences was introduced in the Al-Fakhri (1000) by /wiki/Al-Karaji Al-Karaji Al-Karaji, who used it to prove the /wiki/Binomial_theorem Binomial theorem binomial theorem and properties of /wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle Pascal's triangle Pascal's triangle. Alhazen also developed the method of /wiki/Proof_by_contradiction Proof by contradiction proof by contradiction, as the first attempt at proving the /wiki/Euclidean_geometry Euclidean geometry Euclidean /wiki/Parallel_postulate Parallel postulate parallel postulate. #cite_note-8 [9] Modern /wiki/Proof_theory Proof theory proof theory treats proofs as inductively defined data structures. There is no longer an assumption that axioms are "true" in any sense; this allows for parallel mathematical theories built on alternate sets of axioms (see /wiki/Axiomatic_set_theory Axiomatic set theory Axiomatic set theory and /wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry Non-Euclidean geometry Non-Euclidean geometry for examples). [ /w/index.php?title=Mathematical_proof&action=edit&section=2 Edit section: Nature and purpose edit] Nature and purpose There are two different conceptions of mathematical proof. #cite_note-9 [10] The first is an informal proof, a rigorous natural-language expression that is intended to convince the audience of the truth of a theorem. Because of their use of natural language, the standards of rigor for informal proofs will depend on the audience of the proof. In order to be considered a proof, however, the argument must be rigorous enough; a vague or incomplete argument is not a proof. Informal proofs are the type of proof typically encountered in published mathematics. They are sometimes called "formal proofs" because of their rigor, but logicians use the term "formal proof" to refer to a different type of proof entirely. In logic, a /wiki/Formal_proof Formal proof formal proof is not written in a natural language, but instead uses a /wiki/Formal_language Formal language formal language consisting of certain strings of symbols from a fixed alphabet. This allows the definition of a formal proof to be precisely specified without any ambiguity. The field of /wiki/Proof_theory Proof theory proof theory studies formal proofs and their properties. Although each informal proof can, in theory, be converted into a formal proof, this is rarely done in practice. The study of formal proofs is used to determine properties of provability in general, and to show that certain /wiki/Independence_(mathematical_logic) Independence (mathematical logic) undecidable statements are not provable. A classic question in philosophy asks whether mathematical proofs are /wiki/Analytic_proposition Analytic proposition analytic or /wiki/Synthetic_proposition Synthetic proposition synthetic. Kant, who introduced the /wiki/Analytic-synthetic_distinction Analytic-synthetic distinction analytic-synthetic distinction, believed mathematical proofs are synthetic. Proofs may be viewed as aesthetic objects, admired for their /wiki/Mathematical_beauty Mathematical beauty mathematical beauty. The mathematician /wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s Paul Erd?s Paul Erd?s was known for describing proofs he found particularly elegant as coming from "The Book", a hypothetical tome containing the most beautiful method(s) of proving each theorem. The book /wiki/Proofs_from_THE_BOOK Proofs from THE BOOK Proofs from THE BOOK, published in 2003, is devoted to presenting 32 proofs its editors find particularly pleasing.

Since they are even, they can be written as x=2a and y=2b respectively for integers a and b. Then the sum x + y = 2a + 2b = 2(a + b). From this it is clear x+y has 2 as a factor and therefore is even, so the sum of any two even integers is even. This proof uses definition of even integers, as well as /wiki/Distributivity Distributivity distribution law. [ /w/index.php?title=Mathematical_proof&action=edit&section=5 Edit section: Proof by mathematical induction edit] Proof by mathematical induction Main article: /wiki/Mathematical_induction Mathematical induction Mathematical induction Mathematical induction is not the same as /wiki/Inductive_reasoning Inductive reasoning induction in logic, although the general concept is related. In proof by mathematical induction, a single "base case" is proved, and an "induction rule" is proved, which establishes that if a certain case is true, then another case is true. Applying the induction rule repeatedly, starting from the independently proved base case, proves many, often /wiki/Infinite_set Infinite set infinitely many, other cases. #cite_note-11 [12] Since the base case is true, the infinity of other cases must also be true, even if all of them cannot be proved directly because of their infinite number. A subset of induction is /wiki/Infinite_descent Infinite descent infinite descent. Infinite descent can be used to prove the /wiki/Square_root_of_2#Proofs_of_irrationality Square root of 2 irrationality of the square root of two. A common application of proof by mathematical induction is to prove that a property known to hold for one number holds for all natural numbers #cite_note-12 [13]: Let N = { 1, 2, 3, 4, ... } be the set of natural numbers and P(n) be a mathematical statement involving the natural number n belonging to N such that (i) P(1) is true, i.e., P(n) is true for n = 1 (ii) P(n + 1) is true whenever P(n) is true, i.e., P(n) is true implies that P(n + 1) is true. Then P(n) is true for all natural numbers n. It is common for the phrase "proof by induction" to be used for a "proof by mathematical induction". #cite_note-13 [14] [ /w/index.php?title=Mathematical_proof&action=edit&section=6 Edit section: Proof by transposition edit] Proof by transposition Main article: /wiki/Transposition_(logic) Transposition (logic) Transposition (logic) Proof by transposition or /wiki/Proof_by_contrapositive Proof by contrapositive proof by contrapositive establishes the conclusion "if p then q" by proving the equivalent /wiki/Contrapositive Contrapositive contrapositive statement "if not q then not p". Example: Proposition: If x? is even then x is even. Contrapositive proof: If x is odd (not even) then x = 2k + 1 for an integer k. Thus x? = (2k + 1)? = 4k? + 4k + 1 = 2(2k? + 2k) + 1, where (2k? + 2k) is an integer. Therefore x? is odd (not even). To see the original proposition, suppose x? is even. If x were odd, then we just showed x? would be odd, even though it is supposed to be even; so this case is impossible. The only other possibility is that x is even. [ /w/index.php?title=Mathematical_proof&action=edit&section=7 Edit section: Proof by contradiction edit] Proof by contradiction Main article: /wiki/Proof_by_contradiction Proof by contradiction Proof by contradiction In proof by contradiction (also known as /wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum Reductio ad absurdum reductio ad absurdum, Latin for "by reduction to the absurd"), it is shown that if some statement were true, a logical contradiction occurs, hence the statement must be false. A famous example of proof by contradiction shows that \sqrt{2} is an /wiki/Irrational_number Irrational number irrational number: Suppose that \sqrt{2} were a rational number, so by definition \sqrt{2} = {a\over b} where a and b are non-zero integers with /wiki/Coprime Coprime no common factor. Thus, b\sqrt{2} = a . Squaring both sides yields 2b2 = a2. Since 2 divides the left hand side, 2 must also divide the right hand side (as they are equal and both integers). So a2 is even, which implies that a must also be even. So we can write a = 2c, where c is also an integer. Substitution into the original equation yields 2b2 = (2c)2 = 4c2. Dividing both sides by 2 yields b2 = 2c2. But then, by the same argument as before, 2 divides b2, so b must be even. However, if a and b are both even, they share a factor, namely 2. This contradicts our assumption, so we are forced to conclude that \sqrt{2} is an irrational number.

The number of cases sometimes can become very large. For example, the first proof of the /wiki/Four_color_theorem Four color theorem four color theorem was a proof by exhaustion with 1,936 cases. This proof was controversial because the majority of the cases were checked by a computer program, not by hand. The shortest known proof of the four colour theorem as of 2011 //en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_proof&action=edit [update] still has over 600 cases.

This is not to be confused with an argument that a theorem is 'probably' true.

Often, this takes the form of a proof by contradiction in which the nonexistence of the object is proved to be impossible. In contrast, a constructive proof establishes that a particular object exists by providing a method of finding it. A famous example of a nonconstructive proof shows that there exist two /wiki/Irrational_number Irrational number irrational numbers a and b such that ab is a /wiki/Rational_number Rational number rational number: Either \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} is a rational number and we are done (take a=b=\sqrt{2} ), or \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} is irrational so we can write a=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} and b=\sqrt{2} . This then gives \left (\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right )^{\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2}^{2}=2 , which is thus a rational of the form ab.

Some mathematicians are concerned that the possibility of an error in a computer program or a run-time error in its calculations calls the validity of such computer-assisted proofs into question. In practice, the chances of an error invalidating a computer-assisted proof can be reduced by incorporating redundancy and self-checks into calculations, and by developing multiple independent approaches and programs. Errors can never be completely ruled out in case of verification of a proof by humans either, especially if the proof contains natural language and requires deep mathematical insight.

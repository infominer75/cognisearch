These artifacts do not always reveal the specific process used for solving problems, but the characteristics of the particular /wiki/Numeral_system Numeral system numeral system strongly influence the complexity of the methods. The hieroglyphic system for /wiki/Egyptian_numerals Egyptian numerals Egyptian numerals, like the later /wiki/Roman_numerals Roman numerals Roman numerals, descended from /wiki/Tally_marks Tally marks tally marks used for counting. In both cases, this origin resulted in values that used a /wiki/Decimal Decimal decimal base but did not include /wiki/Positional_notation Positional notation positional notation. Complex calculations with Roman numerals required the assistance of a /wiki/Counting_board Counting board counting board or the /wiki/Roman_abacus Roman abacus Roman abacus to obtain the results. Early number systems that included positional notation were not decimal, including the /wiki/Sexagesimal Sexagesimal sexagesimal (base 60) system for /wiki/Babylonian_numerals Babylonian numerals Babylonian numerals and the /wiki/Vigesimal Vigesimal vigesimal(base 20) system that defined /wiki/Maya_numerals Maya numerals Maya numerals. Because of this place-value concept, the ability to reuse the same digits for different values contributed to simpler and more efficient methods of calculation. The continuous historical development of modern arithmetic starts with the /wiki/Hellenistic_civilization Hellenistic civilization Hellenistic civilization of ancient Greece, although it originated much later than the Babylonian and Egyptian examples. Prior to the works of /wiki/Euclid Euclid Euclid around 300 BC, /wiki/Greek_mathematics Greek mathematics Greek studies in mathematics overlapped with philosophical and mystical beliefs. For example, /wiki/Nicomachus Nicomachus Nicomachus summarized the viewpoint of the earlier /wiki/Pythagoreanism Pythagoreanism Pythagorean approach to numbers, and their relationships to each other, in his /wiki/Introduction_to_Arithmetic Introduction to Arithmetic Introduction to Arithmetic. /wiki/Greek_numerals Greek numerals Greek numerals, derived from the hieratic Egyptian system, also lacked positional notation, and therefore imposed the same complexity on the basic operations of arithmetic. For example, the ancient mathematician /wiki/Archimedes Archimedes Archimedes devoted his entire work /wiki/The_Sand_Reckoner The Sand Reckoner The Sand Reckoner merely to devising a notation for a certain large integer. The gradual development of /wiki/Hindu-Arabic_numerals Hindu-Arabic numerals Hindu-Arabic numerals independently devised the place-value concept and positional notation, which combined the simpler methods for computations with a decimal base and the use of a digit representing /wiki/0_(number) 0 (number) zero. This allowed the system to consistently represent both large and small integers. This approach eventually replaced all other systems. In the early 6th century AD, the Indian mathematician /wiki/Aryabhata Aryabhata Aryabhata incorporated an existing version of this system in his work, and experimented with different notations. In the 7th century, /wiki/Brahmagupta Brahmagupta Brahmagupta established the use of zero as a separate number and determined the results for multiplication, division, addition and subtraction of zero and all other numbers, except for the result of /wiki/Division_by_zero Division by zero division by zero. His contemporary, the /wiki/Syriac_Christianity Syriac Christianity Syriac bishop Severus Sebokht described the excellence of this system as "...valuable methods of calculation which surpass description". The Arabs also learned this new method and called it hesab. Although the /wiki/Codex_Vigilanus Codex Vigilanus Codex Vigilanus described an early form of Arabic numerals (omitting zero) by 976 AD, /wiki/Fibonacci Fibonacci Fibonacci was primarily responsible for spreading their use throughout Europe after the publication of his book /wiki/Liber_Abaci Liber Abaci Liber Abaci in 1202. He considered the significance of this "new" representation of numbers, which he styled the "Method of the Indians" (Latin Modus Indorum), so fundamental that all related mathematical foundations, including the results of /wiki/Pythagoras Pythagoras Pythagoras and the /wiki/Algorism Algorism algorism describing the methods for performing actual calculations, were "almost a mistake" in comparison. In the /wiki/Middle_Ages Middle Ages Middle Ages, arithmetic was one of the seven /wiki/Liberal_arts Liberal arts liberal arts taught in universities. The flourishing of /wiki/Algebra Algebra algebra in the /wiki/Medieval Medieval medieval /wiki/Islamic Islamic Islamic world and in /wiki/Renaissance Renaissance Renaissance /wiki/Europe Europe Europe was an outgrowth of the enormous simplification of /wiki/Computation Computation computation through /wiki/Decimal Decimal decimal notation. Various types of tools exist to assist in numeric calculations. Examples include /wiki/Slide_rule Slide rule slide rules (for multiplication, division, and trigonometry) and /wiki/Nomogram Nomogram nomographs in addition to the electrical /wiki/Calculator Calculator calculator. [ /w/index.php?title=Arithmetic&action=edit&section=2 Edit section: Decimal arithmetic edit] Decimal arithmetic /wiki/Decimal_representation Decimal representation Decimal representation refers exclusively, in common use, to the written /wiki/Numeral_system Numeral system numeral system employing /wiki/Arabic_numerals Arabic numerals arabic numerals as the /wiki/Numerical_digit Numerical digit digits for a /wiki/Radix Radix radix /wiki/Decimal Decimal 10 ("decimal)" /wiki/Positional_notation Positional notation positional notation; however, any /wiki/Numeral_system Numeral system numeral system based on powers of ten, e.g., /wiki/Greek_Numerals Greek Numerals Greek, /wiki/Cyrillic_numerals Cyrillic numerals Cyrillic, /wiki/Roman_numerals Roman numerals roman, or /wiki/Chinese_numerals Chinese numerals Chinese /wiki/Numeral_system Numeral system numerals may conceptually be described as "decimal notation" or "decimal representation". Modern methods for four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction. multiplication and division) were first devised by /wiki/Brahmagupta Brahmagupta Brahmagupta of India. This was known during medieval Europe as "Modus Indoram" or Method of the Indians. Positional notation (also known as "place-value notation") refers to the representation or encoding of /wiki/Number Number numbers using the same symbol for the different /wiki/Orders_of_magnitude Orders of magnitude orders of magnitude (e.g., the "ones place", "tens place", "hundreds place") and, with a /wiki/Radix_point Radix point radix point, using those same symbols to represent /wiki/Arithmetic_fraction Arithmetic fraction fractions (e.g., the "tenths place", “hundredths place"). For example, 507.36 denotes 5 hundreds (102), plus 0 tens (101), plus 7 units (100), plus 3 tenths (10?1) plus 6 hundredths (10?2). /wiki/Zero Zero Zero as a number comparable to the other basic digits is a concept that is essential to this notation, as is the concept of zero’s use as a placeholder, and as is the definition of multiplication and addition with zero. The use of zero as a placeholder and, therefore, the use of a positional notation is first attested to in the /wiki/Jainism Jainism Jain text from /wiki/India India India entitled the /wiki/Lokavibhaga Lokavibhaga Lokavibhâga, dated 458 AD and it was only in the early 13th century that these concepts, transmitted via the /wiki/Mathematics_in_medieval_Islam Mathematics in medieval Islam scholarship of the Arabic world, were introduced into /wiki/Europe Europe Europe by /wiki/Fibonacci Fibonacci Fibonacci #cite_note-2 [3] using the /wiki/Hindu-Arabic_numeral_system Hindu-Arabic numeral system Hindu-Arabic numeral system. /wiki/Algorism Algorism Algorism comprises all of the rules for performing arithmetic computations using this type of written numeral. For example, addition produces the sum of two arbitrary numbers. The result is calculated by the repeated addition of single digits from each number that occupies the same position, proceeding from right to left. An addition table with ten rows and ten columns displays all possible values for each sum. If an individual sum exceeds the value nine, the result is represented with two digits. The rightmost digit is the value for the current position, and the result for the subsequent addition of the digits to the left increases by the value of the second (leftmost) digit, which is always one. This adjustment is termed a carry of the value one. The process for multiplying two arbitrary numbers is similar to the process for addition. A multiplication table with ten rows and ten columns lists the results for each pair of digits. If an individual product of a pair of digits exceeds nine, the carry adjustment increases the result of any subsequent multiplication from digits to the left by a value equal to the second (leftmost) digit, which is any value from one to eight (9 ? 9 = 81). Additional steps define the final result. Similar techniques exist for subtraction and division. The creation of a correct process for multiplication relies on the relationship between values of adjacent digits. The value for any single digit in a numeral depends on its position. Also, each position to the left represents a value ten times larger than the position to the right. In mathematical terms, the /wiki/Exponentiation Exponentiation exponent for the /wiki/Radix Radix radix (base) of ten increases by one (to the left) or decreases by one (to the right). Therefore, the value for any arbitrary digit is multiplied by a value of the form 10n with /wiki/Integer Integer integer n. The list of values corresponding to all possible positions for a single digit is written as {..., 102, 10, 1, 10?1, 10?2, ...}. Repeated multiplication of any value in this list by ten produces another value in the list. In mathematical terminology, this characteristic is defined as /wiki/Closure_(mathematics) Closure (mathematics) closure, and the previous list is described as closed under multiplication. It is the basis for correctly finding the results of multiplication using the previous technique. This outcome is one example of the uses of /wiki/Number_theory Number theory number theory. [ /w/index.php?title=Arithmetic&action=edit&section=3 Edit section: Arithmetic operations edit] Arithmetic operations The basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, although this subject also includes more advanced operations, such as manipulations of /wiki/Percentage Percentage percentages, /wiki/Square_root Square root square roots, /wiki/Exponentiation Exponentiation exponentiation, and /wiki/Logarithm Logarithm logarithmic functions. Arithmetic is performed according to an /wiki/Order_of_operations Order of operations order of operations. Any set of objects upon which all four arithmetic operations (except division by zero) can be performed, and where these four operations obey the usual laws, is called a /wiki/Field_mathematics Field mathematics field. [ /w/index.php?title=Arithmetic&action=edit&section=4 Edit section: Addition (+) edit] Addition (+) Main article: /wiki/Addition Addition Addition Addition is the basic operation of arithmetic. In its simplest form, addition combines two numbers, the addends or /wiki/Term_(mathematics) Term (mathematics) terms, into a single number, the sum of the numbers. Adding more than two numbers can be viewed as repeated addition; this procedure is known as /wiki/Summation Summation summation and includes ways to add infinitely many numbers in an /wiki/Series_(mathematics) Series (mathematics) infinite series; repeated addition of the number /wiki/1_(number) 1 (number) one is the most basic form of /wiki/Counting Counting counting. Addition is /wiki/Commutative Commutative commutative and /wiki/Associative Associative associative so the order the terms are added in does not matter. The /wiki/Identity_element Identity element identity element of addition (the /wiki/Additive_identity Additive identity additive identity) is 0, that is, adding zero to any number yields that same number. Also, the /wiki/Inverse_element Inverse element inverse element of addition (the /wiki/Additive_inverse Additive inverse additive inverse) is the opposite of any number, that is, adding the opposite of any number to the number itself yields the additive identity, 0. For example, the opposite of 7 is ?7, so 7 + (?7) = 0. Addition can be given geometrically as in the following example: If we have two sticks of lengths 2 and 5, then if we place the sticks one after the other, the length of the stick thus formed is 2 + 5 = 7. [ /w/index.php?title=Arithmetic&action=edit&section=5 Edit section: Subtraction (?) edit] Subtraction (?) Main article: /wiki/Subtraction Subtraction Subtraction Subtraction is the opposite of addition. Subtraction finds the difference between two numbers, the minuend minus the subtrahend. If the minuend is larger than the subtrahend, the difference is positive; if the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the difference is negative; if they are equal, the difference is zero. Subtraction is neither commutative nor associative. For that reason, it is often helpful to look at subtraction as addition of the minuend and the opposite of the subtrahend, that is a ? b = a + (?b). When written as a sum, all the properties of addition hold. There are several methods for calculating results, some of which are particularly advantageous to machine calculation. For example, digital computers employ the method of /wiki/Two%27s_complement Two's complement two's complement. Of great importance is the counting up method by which change is made. Suppose an amount P is given to pay the required amount Q, with P greater than Q. Rather than performing the subtraction P ? Q and counting out that amount in change, money is counted out starting at Q and continuing until reaching P. Although the amount counted out must equal the result of the subtraction P ? Q, the subtraction was never really done and the value of P ? Q might still be unknown to the change-maker.

Multiplication also combines two numbers into a single number, the product. The two original numbers are called the multiplier and the multiplicand, sometimes both simply called factors. Multiplication is best viewed as a scaling operation. If the numbers are imagined as lying in a line, multiplication by a number, say x, greater than 1 is the same as stretching everything away from zero uniformly, in such a way that the number 1 itself is stretched to where x was. Similarly, multiplying by a number less than 1 can be imagined as squeezing towards zero. (Again, in such a way that 1 goes to the multiplicand.) Multiplication is commutative and associative; further it is /wiki/Distributivity Distributivity distributive over addition and subtraction. The /wiki/Multiplicative_identity Multiplicative identity multiplicative identity is 1, that is, multiplying any number by 1 yields that same number. Also, the /wiki/Multiplicative_inverse Multiplicative inverse multiplicative inverse is the /wiki/Reciprocal_(mathematics) Reciprocal (mathematics) reciprocal of any number (except zero; zero is the only number without a multiplicative inverse), that is, multiplying the reciprocal of any number by the number itself yields the multiplicative identity. The product of a and b is written as a ? b or a • b. When a or b are expressions not written simply with digits, it is also written by simple juxtaposition: ab. In computer programming languages and software packages in which one can only use characters normally found on a keyboard, it is often written with an asterisk: a * b. [ /w/index.php?title=Arithmetic&action=edit&section=7 Edit section: Division (÷ or /) edit] Division (÷ or /) Main article: /wiki/Division_(mathematics) Division (mathematics) Division (mathematics) Division is essentially the opposite of multiplication. Division finds the quotient of two numbers, the dividend divided by the divisor. Any dividend /wiki/Division_by_zero Division by zero divided by zero is undefined. For positive numbers, if the dividend is larger than the divisor, the quotient is greater than one, otherwise it is less than one (a similar rule applies for negative numbers). The quotient multiplied by the divisor always yields the dividend. Division is neither commutative nor associative. As it is helpful to look at subtraction as addition, it is helpful to look at division as multiplication of the dividend times the /wiki/Multiplicative_inverse Multiplicative inverse reciprocal of the divisor, that is a ÷ b = a ? 1/b. When written as a product, it obeys all the properties of multiplication.

It is in this context that one runs across the /wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic Fundamental theorem of arithmetic fundamental theorem of arithmetic and /wiki/Arithmetic_function Arithmetic function arithmetic functions. A Course in Arithmetic by /wiki/Jean-Pierre_Serre Jean-Pierre Serre Jean-Pierre Serre reflects this usage, as do such phrases as first order arithmetic or arithmetical algebraic geometry.

This study is sometimes known as algorism. The difficulty and unmotivated appearance of these algorithms has long led educators to question this curriculum, advocating the early teaching of more central and intuitive mathematical ideas. One notable movement in this direction was the /wiki/New_Math New Math New Math of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to teach arithmetic in the spirit of axiomatic development from set theory, an echo of the prevailing trend in higher mathematics. #cite_note-3 [4] [ /w/index.php?title=Arithmetic&action=edit&section=10 Edit section: See also edit] See also /wiki/Outline_of_arithmetic Outline of arithmetic Outline of arithmetic /wiki/Lists_of_mathematics_topics Lists of mathematics topics Lists of mathematics topics /wiki/Mathematics Mathematics Mathematics [ /w/index.php?title=Arithmetic&action=edit&section=11 Edit section: Related topics edit] Related topics /wiki/Addition_of_natural_numbers Addition of natural numbers Addition of natural numbers /wiki/Additive_inverse Additive inverse Additive inverse /wiki/Arithmetic_coding Arithmetic coding Arithmetic coding /wiki/Arithmetic_mean Arithmetic mean Arithmetic mean /wiki/Arithmetic_progression Arithmetic progression Arithmetic progression /wiki/Arithmetic_properties Arithmetic properties Arithmetic properties /wiki/Associativity Associativity Associativity /wiki/Commutativity Commutativity Commutativity /wiki/Distributivity Distributivity Distributivity /wiki/Elementary_arithmetic Elementary arithmetic Elementary arithmetic /wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic Finite field arithmetic Finite field arithmetic /wiki/List_of_important_publications_in_mathematics List of important publications in mathematics List of important publications in mathematics /wiki/Number_line Number line Number line /wiki/Integer Integer Integer /wiki/Mental_calculation Mental calculation Mental calculation [ /w/index.php?title=Arithmetic&action=edit&section=12 Edit section: Notes edit] Notes #cite_ref-0 ^ /wiki/Harold_Davenport Harold Davenport Davenport, Harold, The Higher Arithmetic: An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers (7th ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1999, /wiki/Special:BookSources/0521634466 ISBN 0-521-63446-6 #cite_ref-1 ^ Rudman, Peter Strom (20007).

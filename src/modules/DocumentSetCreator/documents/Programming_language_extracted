Programming languages can be used to create /wiki/Program_(machine) Program (machine) programs that control the behavior of a machine and/or to express /wiki/Algorithm Algorithm algorithms precisely. The earliest programming languages predate the /wiki/History_of_computing_hardware History of computing hardware invention of the computer, and were used to direct the behavior of machines such as /wiki/Jacquard_loom Jacquard loom Jacquard looms and /wiki/Player_piano Player piano player pianos. Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computer field, with many more being created every year. Most programming languages describe computation in an /wiki/Imperative_programming Imperative programming imperative style, i.e., as a sequence of commands, although some languages, such as those that support /wiki/Functional_programming Functional programming functional programming or /wiki/Logic_programming Logic programming logic programming, use alternative forms of description. The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of /wiki/Syntax Syntax syntax (form) and /wiki/Semantics Semantics semantics (meaning). Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the /wiki/C_(programming_language) C (programming language) C programming language is specified by an /wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization International Organization for Standardization ISO Standard), while other languages, such as /wiki/Perl Perl Perl 5 and earlier, have a dominant /wiki/Programming_language_implementation Programming language implementation implementation that is used as a /wiki/Reference_implementation Reference implementation reference.

For example /wiki/PostScript PostScript PostScript programs are frequently created by another program to control a computer printer or display. More generally, a programming language may describe computation on some, possibly abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that a complete specification for a programming language includes a description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language. #cite_note-nara2-5 [6] In most practical contexts, a programming language involves a computer; consequently programming languages are usually defined and studied this way. #cite_note-6 [7] Programming languages differ from /wiki/Natural_language Natural language natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people, while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines. Abstractions: Programming languages usually contain /wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science) Abstraction (computer science) abstractions for defining and manipulating /wiki/Data_structure Data structure data structures or controlling the /wiki/Control_flow Control flow flow of execution. The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by the /wiki/Abstraction_principle_(programming) Abstraction principle (programming) abstraction principle; #cite_note-7 [8] this principle is sometimes formulated as recommendation to the programmer to make proper use of such abstractions. #cite_note-8 [9] Expressive power: The /wiki/Theory_of_computation Theory of computation theory of computation classifies languages by the computations they are capable of expressing. All /wiki/Turing_completeness Turing completeness Turing complete languages can implement the same set of /wiki/Algorithm Algorithm algorithms. /wiki/SQL SQL ANSI/ISO SQL and /wiki/Charity_(programming_language) Charity (programming language) Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing complete, yet often called programming languages. #cite_note-9 [10] #cite_note-10 [11] /wiki/Markup_languages Markup languages Markup languages like /wiki/XML XML XML, /wiki/HTML HTML HTML or /wiki/Troff Troff troff, which define /wiki/Structured_data Structured data structured data, are not generally considered programming languages. #cite_note-11 [12] #cite_note-12 [13] #cite_note-13 [14] Programming languages may, however, share the syntax with markup languages if a computational semantics is defined. /wiki/XSLT XSLT XSLT, for example, is a /wiki/Turing_completeness Turing completeness Turing complete XML dialect. #cite_note-14 [15] #cite_note-15 [16] #cite_note-16 [17] Moreover, /wiki/LaTeX LaTeX LaTeX, which is mostly used for structuring documents, also contains a Turing complete subset. #cite_note-17 [18] #cite_note-18 [19] The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language. #cite_note-19 [20] However, the usage of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming languages as a subset of computer languages. #cite_note-20 [21] In this vein, languages used in computing that have a different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for programming. #cite_note-21 [22] Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines, and computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources. #cite_note-22 [23] /wiki/John_C._Reynolds John C. Reynolds John C. Reynolds emphasizes that /wiki/Formal_specification Formal specification formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats. #cite_note-23 [24] [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=2 Edit section: Elements edit] Elements All programming languages have some /wiki/Language_primitive Language primitive primitive building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively.

The language above is /wiki/Python_(programming_language) Python (programming language) Python. Main article: /wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages) Syntax (programming languages) Syntax (programming languages) A programming language's surface form is known as its /wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages) Syntax (programming languages) syntax. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more /wiki/Visual_programming_language Visual programming language graphical in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program. The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either /wiki/Formal_semantics_of_programming_languages Formal semantics of programming languages formal or hard-coded in a /wiki/Reference_implementation_(computing) Reference implementation (computing) reference implementation). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax. Programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of /wiki/Regular_expression Regular expression regular expressions (for /wiki/Lexical_analysis Lexical analysis lexical structure) and /wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form Backus–Naur Form Backus–Naur Form (for /wiki/Context-free_grammar Context-free grammar grammatical structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on /wiki/Lisp_(programming_language) Lisp (programming language) Lisp: expression ::= atom | list atom ::= number | symbol number ::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+ symbol ::= ['A'-'Z''a'-'z'].* list ::= '(' expression* ')' This grammar specifies the following: an expression is either an atom or a list; an atom is either a number or a symbol; a number is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign; a symbol is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace); and a list is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more expressions inside it. The following are examples of well-formed token sequences in this grammar: '12345', '()', '(a b c232 (1))' Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution. In some cases, such programs may exhibit /wiki/Undefined_behavior Undefined behavior undefined behavior. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it. Using /wiki/Natural_language Natural language natural language as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false: " /wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously Colorless green ideas sleep furiously Colorless green ideas sleep furiously." is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning. "John is a married bachelor." is grammatically well-formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be true. The following C language fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation *p >> 4 has no meaning for a value having a complex type and p->im is not defined because the value of p is the /wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming) Pointer (computer programming) null pointer): complex *p = NULL; complex abs_p = sqrt(*p >> 4 + p->im); If the /wiki/Type_declaration Type declaration type declaration on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on compilation, as the variable "p" would not be defined. But the program would still be syntactically correct, since type declarations provide only semantic information. The grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the /wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy Chomsky hierarchy Chomsky hierarchy. The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are /wiki/Context-free_grammar Context-free grammar context-free grammars. #cite_note-24 [25] Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase. Languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an /wiki/Undecidable_problem Undecidable problem undecidable problem, and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution. #cite_note-25 [26] In contrast to /wiki/Lisp_macro Lisp macro Lisp's macro system and Perl's BEGIN blocks, which may contain general computations, C macros are merely string replacements, and do not require code execution. #cite_note-26 [27] [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=4 Edit section: Semantics edit] Semantics The term /wiki/Semantics#Computer_science Semantics Semantics refers to the meaning of languages, as opposed to their form ( #Syntax syntax). [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=5 Edit section: Static semantics edit] Static semantics The static semantics defines restrictions on the structure of valid texts that are hard or impossible to express in standard syntactic formalisms. #cite_note-Aaby_2004-0 [1] For compiled languages, static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time. Examples include checking that every /wiki/Identifier Identifier identifier is declared before it is used (in languages that require such declarations) or that the labels on the arms of a /wiki/Case_statement Case statement case statement are distinct. #cite_note-27 [28] Many important restrictions of this type, like checking that identifiers are used in the appropriate context (e.g. not adding an integer to a function name), or that /wiki/Subroutine Subroutine subroutine calls have the appropriate number and type of arguments, can be enforced by defining them as rules in a /wiki/Logic Logic logic called a /wiki/Type_system Type system type system. Other forms of /wiki/Static_code_analysis Static code analysis static analyses like /wiki/Data_flow_analysis Data flow analysis data flow analysis may also be part of static semantics. Newer programming languages like /wiki/Java_(programming_language) Java (programming language) Java and /wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) C Sharp (programming language) C# have /wiki/Definite_assignment_analysis Definite assignment analysis definite assignment analysis, a form of data flow analysis, as part of their static semantics. [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=6 Edit section: Dynamic semantics edit] Dynamic semantics Main article: /wiki/Semantics_of_programming_languages Semantics of programming languages Semantics of programming languages Once data has been specified, the machine must be instructed to perform operations on the data. For example, the semantics may define the /wiki/Evaluation_strategy Evaluation strategy strategy by which expressions are evaluated to values, or the manner in which /wiki/Control_flow Control flow control structures conditionally execute /wiki/Statement_(computer_science) Statement (computer science) statements. The dynamic semantics (also known as execution semantics) of a language defines how and when the various constructs of a language should produce a program behavior. There are many ways of defining execution semantics. Natural language is often used to specify the execution semantics of languages commonly used in practice. A significant amount of academic research went into /wiki/Formal_semantics_of_programming_languages Formal semantics of programming languages formal semantics of programming languages, which allow execution semantics to be specified in a formal manner. Results from this field of research have seen limited application to programming language design and implementation outside academia. [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=7 Edit section: Type system edit] Type system Main articles: /wiki/Data_type Data type Data type, /wiki/Type_system Type system Type system, and /wiki/Type_safety Type safety Type safety A type system defines how a programming language classifies values and expressions into types, how it can manipulate those types and how they interact. The goal of a type system is to verify and usually enforce a certain level of correctness in programs written in that language by detecting certain incorrect operations. Any /wiki/Decidability_(logic) Decidability (logic) decidable type system involves a trade-off: while it rejects many incorrect programs, it can also prohibit some correct, albeit unusual programs. In order to bypass this downside, a number of languages have type loopholes, usually unchecked /wiki/Type_conversion#Explicit_type_conversion Type conversion casts that may be used by the programmer to explicitly allow a normally disallowed operation between different types. In most typed languages, the type system is used only to /wiki/Type_checking Type checking type check programs, but a number of languages, usually functional ones, /wiki/Type_inference Type inference infer types, relieving the programmer from the need to write type annotations. The formal design and study of type systems is known as /wiki/Type_theory Type theory type theory. [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=8 Edit section: Typed versus untyped languages edit] Typed versus untyped languages A language is typed if the specification of every operation defines types of data to which the operation is applicable, with the implication that it is not applicable to other types. #cite_note-typing-28 [29] For example, the data represented by "this text between the quotes" is a /wiki/String_literal String literal string. In most programming languages, dividing a number by a string has no meaning. Most modern programming languages will therefore reject any program attempting to perform such an operation. In some languages, the meaningless operation will be detected when the program is compiled ("static" type checking), and rejected by the compiler, while in others, it will be detected when the program is run ("dynamic" type checking), resulting in a runtime /wiki/Exception_handling Exception handling exception. A special case of typed languages are the single-type languages. These are often scripting or markup languages, such as /wiki/REXX REXX REXX or /wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML, and have only one data type—most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic and numeric data. In contrast, an untyped language, such as most /wiki/Assembly_language Assembly language assembly languages, allows any operation to be performed on any data, which are generally considered to be sequences of bits of various lengths. #cite_note-typing-28 [29] High-level languages which are untyped include /wiki/BCPL BCPL BCPL and some varieties of /wiki/Forth_(programming_language) Forth (programming language) Forth. In practice, while few languages are considered typed from the point of view of /wiki/Type_theory Type theory type theory (verifying or rejecting all operations), most modern languages offer a degree of typing. #cite_note-typing-28 [29] Many production languages provide means to bypass or subvert the type system (see /wiki/Type_conversion#Explicit_type_conversion Type conversion casting). [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=9 Edit section: Static versus dynamic typing edit] Static versus dynamic typing In /wiki/Type_system Type system static typing, all expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed, typically at compile-time. For example, 1 and (2+2) are integer expressions; they cannot be passed to a function that expects a string, or stored in a variable that is defined to hold dates. #cite_note-typing-28 [29] Statically typed languages can be either /wiki/Manifest_typing Manifest typing manifestly typed or /wiki/Type_inference Type inference type-inferred. In the first case, the programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions (for example, at variable /wiki/Declaration_(computer_science) Declaration (computer science) declarations). In the second case, the compiler infers the types of expressions and declarations based on context. Most mainstream statically typed languages, such as /wiki/C%2B%2B C++ C++, /wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) C Sharp (programming language) C# and /wiki/Java_(programming_language) Java (programming language) Java, are manifestly typed. Complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages, such as /wiki/Haskell_(programming_language) Haskell (programming language) Haskell and /wiki/ML_(programming_language) ML (programming language) ML. However, many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference; for example, /wiki/Java_(programming_language) Java (programming language) Java and /wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) C Sharp (programming language) C# both infer types in certain limited cases. #cite_note-29 [30] /wiki/Type_system Type system Dynamic typing, also called latent typing, determines the type-safety of operations at runtime; in other words, types are associated with runtime values rather than textual expressions. #cite_note-typing-28 [29] As with type-inferred languages, dynamically typed languages do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions. Among other things, this may permit a single variable to refer to values of different types at different points in the program execution. However, type /wiki/Software_bug Software bug errors cannot be automatically detected until a piece of code is actually executed, potentially making /wiki/Debugging Debugging debugging more difficult. /wiki/Lisp_(programming_language) Lisp (programming language) Lisp, /wiki/Perl Perl Perl, /wiki/Python_(programming_language) Python (programming language) Python, /wiki/JavaScript JavaScript JavaScript, and /wiki/Ruby_(programming_language) Ruby (programming language) Ruby are dynamically typed. [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=10 Edit section: Weak and strong typing edit] Weak and strong typing /wiki/Weak_typing Weak typing Weak typing allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a /wiki/String_(computer_science) String (computer science) string as a number. #cite_note-typing-28 [29] This can occasionally be useful, but it can also allow some kinds of program faults to go undetected at /wiki/Compile_time Compile time compile time and even at /wiki/Run_time_(program_lifecycle_phase) Run time (program lifecycle phase) run-time. /wiki/Strongly_typed_programming_language Strongly typed programming language Strong typing prevents the above. An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error. #cite_note-typing-28 [29] Strongly typed languages are often termed type-safe or /wiki/Type_safety Type safety safe. An alternative definition for "weakly typed" refers to languages, such as /wiki/Perl Perl Perl and /wiki/JavaScript JavaScript JavaScript, which permit a large number of implicit type conversions. In JavaScript, for example, the expression 2 * x implicitly converts x to a number, and this conversion succeeds even if x is null, undefined, an Array, or a string of letters. Such implicit conversions are often useful, but they can mask programming errors. Strong and static are now generally considered orthogonal concepts, but usage in the literature differs. Some use the term strongly typed to mean strongly, statically typed, or, even more confusingly, to mean simply statically typed. Thus /wiki/C_(programming_language) C (programming language) C has been called both strongly typed and weakly, statically typed. #cite_note-30 [31] #cite_note-31 [32] [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=11 Edit section: Standard library and run-time system edit] Standard library and run-time system Main article: /wiki/Standard_library Standard library Standard library Most programming languages have an associated core /wiki/Library_(computing) Library (computing) library (sometimes known as the 'standard library', especially if it is included as part of the published language standard), which is conventionally made available by all implementations of the language. Core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms for input and output. A language's core library is often treated as part of the language by its users, although the designers may have treated it as a separate entity. Many language specifications define a core that must be made available in all implementations, and in the case of standardized languages this core library may be required. The line between a language and its core library therefore differs from language to language. Indeed, some languages are designed so that the meanings of certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring to the core library. For example, in /wiki/Java_(programming_language) Java (programming language) Java, a string literal is defined as an instance of the java.lang.String class; similarly, in /wiki/Smalltalk Smalltalk Smalltalk, an /wiki/Anonymous_function Anonymous function anonymous function expression (a "block") constructs an instance of the library's BlockContext class. Conversely, /wiki/Scheme_(programming_language) Scheme (programming language) Scheme contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice to construct the rest of the language as library macros, and so the language designers do not even bother to say which portions of the language must be implemented as language constructs, and which must be implemented as parts of a library. [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=12 Edit section: Design and implementation edit] Design and implementation Programming languages share properties with natural languages related to their purpose as vehicles for communication, having a syntactic form separate from its semantics, and showing language families of related languages branching one from another. #cite_note-Fischer-2 [3] #cite_note-levenez-32 [33] But as artificial constructs, they also differ in fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage. A significant difference is that a programming language can be fully described and studied in its entirety, since it has a precise and finite definition. #cite_note-33 [34] By contrast, natural languages have changing meanings given by their users in different communities. While /wiki/Constructed_languages Constructed languages constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from the ground up with a specific purpose, they lack the precise and complete semantic definition that a programming language has. Many programming languages have been designed from scratch, altered to meet new needs, and combined with other languages. Many have eventually fallen into disuse. Although there have been attempts to design one "universal" programming language that serves all purposes, all of them have failed to be generally accepted as filling this role. #cite_note-34 [35] The need for diverse programming languages arises from the diversity of contexts in which languages are used: Programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists to huge systems written by hundreds of /wiki/Programmer Programmer programmers. Programmers range in expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else, to experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity. Programs must balance speed, size, and simplicity on systems ranging from /wiki/Microcontroller Microcontroller microcontrollers to /wiki/Supercomputer Supercomputer supercomputers. Programs may be written once and not change for generations, or they may undergo continual modification. Finally, programmers may simply differ in their tastes: they may be accustomed to discussing problems and expressing them in a particular language. One common trend in the development of programming languages has been to add more ability to solve problems using a higher level of /wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science) Abstraction (computer science) abstraction. The earliest programming languages were tied very closely to the underlying hardware of the computer. As new programming languages have developed, features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions. Because programmers are less tied to the complexity of the computer, their programs can do more computing with less effort from the programmer. This lets them write more functionality per time unit. #cite_note-35 [36] /wiki/Natural_language_processing Natural language processing Natural language processors have been proposed as a way to eliminate the need for a specialized language for programming. However, this goal remains distant and its benefits are open to debate. /wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra Edsger W. Dijkstra Edsger W. Dijkstra took the position that the use of a formal language is essential to prevent the introduction of meaningless constructs, and dismissed natural language programming as "foolish". #cite_note-36 [37] /wiki/Alan_Perlis Alan Perlis Alan Perlis was similarly dismissive of the idea. #cite_note-37 [38] Hybrid approaches have been taken in /wiki/Structured_English Structured English Structured English and /wiki/SQL SQL SQL. A language's designers and users must construct a number of artifacts that govern and enable the practice of programming. The most important of these artifacts are the language specification and implementation. [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=13 Edit section: Specification edit] Specification Main article: /wiki/Programming_language_specification Programming language specification Programming language specification The specification of a programming language is intended to provide a definition that the language /wiki/Programmer Programmer users and the /wiki/Programming_language_implementation Programming language implementation implementors can use to determine whether the behavior of a /wiki/Computer_program Computer program program is correct, given its /wiki/Source_code Source code source code. A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following: An explicit definition of the syntax, static semantics, and execution semantics of the language. While syntax is commonly specified using a formal grammar, semantic definitions may be written in /wiki/Natural_language Natural language natural language (e.g., as in the /wiki/C_(programming_language) C (programming language) C language), or a /wiki/Formal_semantics_of_programming_languages Formal semantics of programming languages formal semantics (e.g., as in /wiki/Standard_ML Standard ML Standard ML #cite_note-38 [39] and /wiki/Scheme_(programming_language) Scheme (programming language) Scheme #cite_note-39 [40] specifications). A description of the behavior of a /wiki/Compiler Compiler translator for the language (e.g., the /wiki/C%2B%2B C++ C++ and /wiki/Fortran Fortran Fortran specifications). The syntax and semantics of the language have to be inferred from this description, which may be written in natural or a formal language. A /wiki/Reference_implementation Reference implementation reference or model implementation, sometimes /wiki/Meta-circular_evaluator Meta-circular evaluator written in the language being specified (e.g., /wiki/Prolog Prolog Prolog or /wiki/REXX REXX ANSI REXX #cite_note-40 [41]). The syntax and semantics of the language are explicit in the behavior of the reference implementation. [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=14 Edit section: Implementation edit] Implementation Main article: /wiki/Programming_language_implementation Programming language implementation Programming language implementation An implementation of a programming language provides a way to execute that program on one or more configurations of hardware and software. There are, broadly, two approaches to programming language implementation: /wiki/Compiler Compiler compilation and /wiki/Interpreter_(computing) Interpreter (computing) interpretation. It is generally possible to implement a language using either technique. The output of a /wiki/Compiler Compiler compiler may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter. In some implementations that make use of the interpreter approach there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting. For instance, some implementations of /wiki/BASIC BASIC BASIC compile and then execute the source a line at a time. Programs that are executed directly on the hardware usually run several orders of magnitude faster than those that are interpreted in software.[ /wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed Wikipedia:Citation needed This claim needs references to reliable sources from October 2008 citation needed] One technique for improving the performance of interpreted programs is /wiki/Just-in-time_compilation Just-in-time compilation just-in-time compilation.

[ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=15 Edit section: Usage edit] Usage Thousands of different programming languages have been created, mainly in the computing field. #cite_note-41 [42] Programming languages differ from most other forms of human expression in that they require a greater degree of precision and completeness. When using a natural language to communicate with other people, human authors and speakers can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect their intent to be understood. However, figuratively speaking, computers "do exactly what they are told to do", and cannot "understand" what code the programmer intended to write. The combination of the language definition, a program, and the program's inputs must fully specify the external behavior that occurs when the program is executed, within the domain of control of that program. On the other hand, ideas about an algorithm can be communicated to humans without the precision required for execution by using /wiki/Pseudocode Pseudocode pseudocode, which interleaves natural language with code written in a programming language. A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A /wiki/Programmer Programmer programmer uses the /wiki/Abstraction_(computer_science) Abstraction (computer science) abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called /wiki/Language_primitive Language primitive primitives). #cite_note-42 [43] /wiki/Programming Programming Programming is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment. Programs for a computer might be /wiki/Execution_(computing) Execution (computing) executed in a /wiki/Batch_processing Batch processing batch process without human interaction, or a user might type /wiki/Command_(computing) Command (computing) commands in an /wiki/Session_(computer_science) Session (computer science) interactive session of an /wiki/Interpreter_(computing) Interpreter (computing) interpreter. In this case the "commands" are simply programs, whose execution is chained together. When a language is used to give commands to a software application (such as a /wiki/Shell_(computing) Shell (computing) shell) it is called a /wiki/Scripting_language Scripting language scripting language.[ /wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed Wikipedia:Citation needed This claim needs references to reliable sources from March 2009 citation needed] [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=16 Edit section: Measuring language usage edit] Measuring language usage Main article: /wiki/Measuring_programming_language_popularity Measuring programming language popularity Measuring programming language popularity It is difficult to determine which programming languages are most widely used, and what usage means varies by context. One language may occupy the greater number of programmer hours, a different one have more lines of code, and a third utilize the most CPU time. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications. For example, /wiki/COBOL COBOL COBOL is still strong[ /wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed Wikipedia:Citation needed This claim needs references to reliable sources from November 2011 citation needed] in the corporate data center, often on large /wiki/Mainframe_computer Mainframe computer mainframes; /wiki/Fortran Fortran FORTRAN in scientific and engineering applications; and /wiki/C_(programming_language) C (programming language) C in embedded applications and operating systems. Other languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications. Various methods of measuring language popularity, each subject to a different bias over what is measured, have been proposed: counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language #cite_note-43 [44] the number of books sold that teach or describe the language #cite_note-44 [45] estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language—which may underestimate languages not often found in public searches #cite_note-45 [46] counts of language references (i.e., to the name of the language) found using a web search engine. Combining and averaging information from various internet sites, langpop.com claims that #cite_note-46 [47] in 2008 the 10 most cited programming languages are (in alphabetical order): /wiki/C_(programming_language) C (programming language) C, /wiki/C%2B%2B C++ C++, /wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) C Sharp (programming language) C#, /wiki/Java_(programming_language) Java (programming language) Java, /wiki/JavaScript JavaScript JavaScript, /wiki/Perl Perl Perl, /wiki/PHP PHP PHP, /wiki/Python_(programming_language) Python (programming language) Python, /wiki/Ruby_(programming_language) Ruby (programming language) Ruby, and /wiki/SQL SQL SQL. [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=17 Edit section: Taxonomies edit] Taxonomies For more details on this topic, see /wiki/Categorical_list_of_programming_languages Categorical list of programming languages Categorical list of programming languages. There is no overarching classification scheme for programming languages. A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language. Languages commonly arise by combining the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time. Ideas that originate in one language will diffuse throughout a family of related languages, and then leap suddenly across familial gaps to appear in an entirely different family. The task is further complicated by the fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes. For example, Java is both an object-oriented language (because it encourages object-oriented organization) and a concurrent language (because it contains built-in constructs for running multiple /wiki/Thread_(computer_science) Thread (computer science) threads in parallel). /wiki/Python_(programming_language) Python (programming language) Python is an object-oriented /wiki/Scripting_language Scripting language scripting language. In broad strokes, programming languages divide into /wiki/Programming_paradigm Programming paradigm programming paradigms and a classification by intended domain of use. Traditionally, programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e. issuing commands. These are generally called /wiki/Imperative_programming Imperative programming imperative programming languages. A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of /wiki/Declarative_programming Declarative programming declarative programming. #cite_note-47 [48] More refined paradigms include /wiki/Procedural_programming Procedural programming procedural programming, /wiki/Object-oriented_programming Object-oriented programming object-oriented programming, /wiki/Functional_programming Functional programming functional programming, and /wiki/Logic_programming Logic programming logic programming; some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic. An /wiki/Assembly_language Assembly language assembly language is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture. By purpose, programming languages might be considered general purpose, system programming languages, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages (or a combination of these). #cite_note-48 [49] Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals. #cite_note-49 [50] A programming language may also be classified by factors unrelated to programming paradigm. For instance, most programming languages use /wiki/English_language English language English language keywords, while /wiki/Non-English-based_programming_languages Non-English-based programming languages a minority do not. Other languages may be classified as being /wiki/Esoteric_programming_language Esoteric programming language deliberately esoteric or not.

The 19th century saw the invention of "programmable" /wiki/Loom Loom looms and /wiki/Player_piano Player piano player piano scrolls, both of which implemented examples of /wiki/Domain-specific_language Domain-specific language domain-specific languages. By the beginning of the twentieth century, punch cards encoded data and directed mechanical processing. In the 1930s and 1940s, the formalisms of /wiki/Alonzo_Church Alonzo Church Alonzo Church's /wiki/Lambda_calculus Lambda calculus lambda calculus and /wiki/Alan_Turing Alan Turing Alan Turing's /wiki/Turing_machine Turing machine Turing machines provided mathematical abstractions for expressing /wiki/Algorithm Algorithm algorithms; the lambda calculus remains influential in language design. #cite_note-50 [51] In the 1940s, the first electrically powered digital computers were created. The first /wiki/High-level_programming_language High-level programming language high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was /wiki/Plankalk%C3%BCl Plankalkül Plankalkül, developed for the German /wiki/Z3_(computer) Z3 (computer) Z3 by /wiki/Konrad_Zuse Konrad Zuse Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000. #cite_note-51 [52] Programmers of early 1950s computers, notably /wiki/UNIVAC_I UNIVAC I UNIVAC I and /wiki/IBM_701 IBM 701 IBM 701, used /wiki/Machine_code Machine code machine language programs, that is, the /wiki/First-generation_programming_language First-generation programming language first generation language (1GL). 1GL programming was quickly superseded by similarly machine-specific, but /wiki/Mnemonic Mnemonic mnemonic, /wiki/Second-generation_programming_language Second-generation programming language second generation languages (2GL) known as /wiki/Assembly_language Assembly language assembly languages or "assembler". Later in the 1950s, assembly language programming, which had evolved to include the use of /wiki/Macro_instruction Macro instruction macro instructions, was followed by the development of /wiki/Third-generation_programming_language Third-generation programming language "third generation" programming languages (3GL), such as /wiki/Fortran Fortran FORTRAN, /wiki/Lisp_(programming_language) Lisp (programming language) LISP, and /wiki/COBOL COBOL COBOL. #cite_note-52 [53] 3GLs are more abstract and are "portable", or at least implemented similarly on computers that do not support the same native machine code. Updated versions of all of these 3GLs are still in general use, and each has strongly influenced the development of later languages. #cite_note-influences-53 [54] At the end of the 1950s, the language formalized as /wiki/ALGOL ALGOL ALGOL 60 was introduced, and most later programming languages are, in many respects, descendants of Algol. #cite_note-influences-53 [54] The format and use of the early programming languages was heavily influenced by the /wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punch_card_era Computer programming in the punch card era constraints of the interface. #cite_note-54 [55] [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=20 Edit section: Refinement edit] Refinement The period from the 1960s to the late 1970s brought the development of the major language paradigms now in use, though many aspects were refinements of ideas in the very first /wiki/Third-generation_programming_language Third-generation programming language Third-generation programming languages: /wiki/APL_(programming_language) APL (programming language) APL introduced /wiki/Array_programming Array programming array programming and influenced /wiki/Functional_programming Functional programming functional programming. #cite_note-55 [56] /wiki/PL/I PL/I PL/I (NPL) was designed in the early 1960s to incorporate the best ideas from FORTRAN and COBOL. In the 1960s, /wiki/Simula Simula Simula was the first language designed to support /wiki/Object-oriented_programming Object-oriented programming object-oriented programming; in the mid-1970s, /wiki/Smalltalk Smalltalk Smalltalk followed with the first "purely" object-oriented language. /wiki/C_(programming_language) C (programming language) C was developed between 1969 and 1973 as a /wiki/System_programming System programming system programming language, and remains popular. #cite_note-56 [57] /wiki/Prolog Prolog Prolog, designed in 1972, was the first /wiki/Logic_programming Logic programming logic programming language. In 1978, /wiki/ML_(programming_language) ML (programming language) ML built a polymorphic type system on top of Lisp, pioneering /wiki/Type_system Type system statically typed /wiki/Functional_programming Functional programming functional programming languages. Each of these languages spawned an entire family of descendants, and most modern languages count at least one of them in their ancestry. The 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of /wiki/Structured_programming Structured programming structured programming, and whether programming languages should be designed to support it. #cite_note-57 [58] /wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra Edsger W. Dijkstra Edsger Dijkstra, in a famous 1968 letter published in the /wiki/Communications_of_the_ACM Communications of the ACM Communications of the ACM, argued that /wiki/Goto Goto GOTO statements should be eliminated from all "higher level" programming languages. #cite_note-58 [59] The 1960s and 1970s also saw expansion of techniques that reduced the footprint of a program as well as improved productivity of the programmer and user. The /wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punch_card_era Computer programming in the punch card era card deck for an early /wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language Fourth-generation programming language 4GL was a lot smaller for the same functionality expressed in a /wiki/Third-generation_programming_language Third-generation programming language 3GL deck. [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=21 Edit section: Consolidation and growth edit] Consolidation and growth The 1980s were years of relative consolidation. /wiki/C%2B%2B C++ C++ combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized /wiki/Ada_(programming_language) Ada (programming language) Ada, a systems programming language derived from /wiki/Pascal_(programming_language) Pascal (programming language) Pascal and intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called /wiki/Fifth-generation_programming_language Fifth-generation programming language "fifth generation" languages that incorporated logic programming constructs. #cite_note-59 [60] The functional languages community moved to standardize /wiki/ML_(programming_language) ML (programming language) ML and Lisp. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decade. One important trend in language design for programming large-scale systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of modules, or large-scale organizational units of code. /wiki/Modula-2 Modula-2 Modula-2, Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s, although other languages, such as /wiki/PL/I PL/I PL/I, already had extensive support for modular programming. Module systems were often wedded to /wiki/Generic_programming Generic programming generic programming constructs. #cite_note-60 [61] The rapid growth of the /wiki/Internet Internet Internet in the mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages. /wiki/Perl Perl Perl, originally a Unix scripting tool first released in 1987, became common in dynamic /wiki/Website Website websites. /wiki/Java_(programming_language) Java (programming language) Java came to be used for server-side programming, and bytecode virtual machines became popular again in commercial settings with their promise of " /wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere Write once, run anywhere Write once, run anywhere" ( /wiki/UCSD_Pascal UCSD Pascal UCSD Pascal had been popular for a time in the early 1980s). These developments were not fundamentally novel, rather they were refinements to existing languages and paradigms, and largely based on the C family of programming languages. Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Current directions include security and reliability verification, new kinds of modularity ( /wiki/Mixin Mixin mixins, /wiki/Delegation_(programming) Delegation (programming) delegates, /wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming Aspect-oriented programming aspects), and database integration such as Microsoft's /wiki/Language_Integrated_Query Language Integrated Query LINQ. The /wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language Fourth-generation programming language 4GLs are examples of languages which are domain-specific, such as /wiki/SQL SQL SQL, which manipulates and returns /wiki/Set_(computer_science) Set (computer science) sets of data rather than the scalar values which are canonical to most programming languages. /wiki/Perl Perl Perl, for example, with its ' /wiki/Here_document Here document here document' can hold multiple 4GL programs, as well as multiple JavaScript programs, in part of its own perl code and use variable interpolation in the 'here document' to support multi-language programming. #cite_note-61 [62] [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=22 Edit section: See also edit] See also /wiki/File:Internet_map_1024.jpg Portal icon /wiki/Portal:Computer_science Portal:Computer science Computer science portal /wiki/File:8bit-dynamiclist.gif Portal icon /wiki/Portal:Computer_programming Portal:Computer programming Computer programming portal Book icon /wiki/Book:Programming_Languages Book:Programming Languages Book: Programming Languages /wiki/Wikipedia:Books Wikipedia:Books Wikipedia books are collections of articles that can be downloaded or ordered in print. /wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(basic_instructions) Comparison of programming languages (basic instructions) Comparison of programming languages (basic instructions) /wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages Comparison of programming languages Comparison of programming languages /wiki/Computer_programming Computer programming Computer programming /wiki/Computer_science Computer science Computer science and /wiki/Outline_of_computer_science Outline of computer science Outline of computer science /wiki/Educational_programming_language Educational programming language Educational programming language /wiki/Invariant_based_programming Invariant based programming Invariant based programming /wiki/Lists_of_programming_languages Lists of programming languages Lists of programming languages /wiki/List_of_programming_language_researchers List of programming language researchers List of programming language researchers /wiki/Literate_programming Literate programming Literate programming /wiki/Dialect_(computing) Dialect (computing) Dialect (computing) /wiki/Programming_language_theory Programming language theory Programming language theory /wiki/Pseudocode Pseudocode Pseudocode /wiki/Scientific_language Scientific language Scientific language /wiki/Software_engineering Software engineering Software engineering and /wiki/List_of_software_engineering_topics List of software engineering topics List of software engineering topics [ /w/index.php?title=Programming_language&action=edit&section=23 Edit section: References edit] References ^ #cite_ref-Aaby_2004_0-0 a #cite_ref-Aaby_2004_0-1 b #cite_ref-Aaby_2004_0-2 c Aaby, Anthony (2004). http://burks.brighton.ac.uk/burks/pcinfo/progdocs/plbook/index.htm Introduction to Programming Languages. http://burks.brighton.ac.uk/burks/pcinfo/progdocs/plbook/index.htm http://burks.brighton.ac.uk/burks/pcinfo/progdocs/plbook/index.htm. ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&rft.genre=book&rft.btitle=Introduction+to+Programming+Languages&rft.aulast=Aaby&rft.aufirst=Anthony&rft.au=Aaby%2C%26%2332%3BAnthony&rft.date=2004&rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fburks.brighton.ac.uk%2Fburks%2Fpcinfo%2Fprogdocs%2Fplbook%2Findex.htm&rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikipedia.org:Programming_language   #cite_ref-1 ^ In mathematical terms, this means the programming language is /wiki/Turing_completeness Turing completeness Turing-complete MacLennan, Bruce J.

In a computer language, there are only finitely many names--or registers--which can assume only finitely many values--or states--and these states are not further distinguished in terms of any other attributes. [author's footnote:] This may sound like a truism but its implications are far reaching. For example, it would imply that any model for programming languages, by fixing certain of its parameters or features, should be reducible in a natural way to a model for computer languages." #cite_ref-23 ^ John C.

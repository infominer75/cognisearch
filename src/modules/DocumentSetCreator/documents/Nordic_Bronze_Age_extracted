Many /wiki/Rock_carving Rock carving rock carvings depict ships, and the large stone burial monuments known as /wiki/Stone_ship Stone ship stone ships suggest that shipping played an important role. Thousands of rock carvings depict ships, most probably representing sewn plank built canoes for warfare, fishing and trade. These may have a history as far back as the neolithic period and continue in to the Pre-Roman Iron Age, as shown by the /wiki/Hjortspring_boat Hjortspring boat Hjortspring boat. #cite_note-1 [2] There are many mounds and /wiki/Rock_carving Rock carving rock carving sites from the period. Numerous artifacts of bronze and gold are found. No written language existed in the /wiki/Nordic_countries Nordic countries Nordic countries during the Bronze Age. The rock carvings have been dated through comparison with depicted artifacts, for example bronze axes and swords. (There are also numerous /wiki/Nordic_Stone_Age Nordic Stone Age Nordic Stone Age rock carvings in the north of Scandinavia, mostly portraying elk.) [ /w/index.php?title=Nordic_Bronze_Age&action=edit&section=2 Edit section: Sub-periodization edit] Sub-periodization /wiki/Oscar_Montelius Oscar Montelius Oscar Montelius, who coined the term used for the period, divided it into six distinct sub-periods in his piece Om tidsbestämning inom bronsåldern med särskilt avseende på Skandinavien ("On Bronze Age dating with particular focus on Scandinavia") published in 1885 which is still in wide use. His absolute chronology has held up well against radiocarbon dating, with the exception that the period's start is closer to 1700 BC than 1800 BC, as Montelius suggested. For /wiki/Central_Europe Central Europe Central Europe a different system developed by /wiki/Paul_Reinecke Paul Reinecke Paul Reinecke is commonly used, as each area has its own artefact types and archaeological periods. A broader subdivision is the "Early Bronze Age" between 1700 BC and 1100 BC and the "Late Bronze Age" 1100 BC to 550 BC. These divisions and periods are then followed by the /wiki/Pre-Roman_Iron_Age Pre-Roman Iron Age Pre-Roman Iron Age. [ /w/index.php?title=Nordic_Bronze_Age&action=edit&section=3 Edit section: Climate edit] Climate The Nordic Bronze Age was characterized by a warm climate that began with a climate change around 2700 BC (comparable to that of present-day central Germany and northern France). The warm climate permitted a relatively dense population and good farming, for example /wiki/Grape Grape grapes were grown in Scandinavia at this time. However a small change in climate between 850 BC and 760 BC and a more radical one around 650 BC brought in a deteriorating, wetter and colder climate (sometimes believed to have given rise to the legend of the /wiki/Fimbulwinter Fimbulwinter Fimbulwinter). [ /w/index.php?title=Nordic_Bronze_Age&action=edit&section=4 Edit section: Religion edit] Religion Not much is known about the Nordic Bronze Age religion, since written sources are lacking. However numerous archaeological finds draw a vague picture of what the religion might have been, but only some possible sects of it and only certain possible tribes. Some of the best clues to the religion of this period come from the rock carvings scattered through Northern Europe.

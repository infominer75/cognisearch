(August 2007) In traditional /wiki/Logic Logic logic, an axiom or postulate is a proposition that is not proven or demonstrated but considered either to be /wiki/Self-evidence Self-evidence self-evident or to define and delimit the realm of analysis. In other words, an axiom is a logical statement that is assumed to be true. Therefore, its truth is taken for granted, and serves as a starting point for deducing and inferring other (theory dependent) truths. In /wiki/Mathematics Mathematics mathematics, the term axiom is used in two related but distinguishable senses: #Logical_axioms "logical axioms" and #Non-logical_axioms "non-logical axioms". In both senses, an axiom is any mathematical statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived. Unlike /wiki/Theorem Theorem theorems, axioms (unless redundant) cannot be derived by principles of deduction, nor are they demonstrable by /wiki/Mathematical_proof Mathematical proof mathematical proofs, simply because they are starting points; there is nothing else from which they logically follow (otherwise they would be classified as theorems). Logical axioms are usually statements that are taken to be universally true (e.g., (A and B) implies A), while non-logical axioms (e.g., a + b = b + a) are actually defining properties for the domain of a specific mathematical theory (such as /wiki/Arithmetic Arithmetic arithmetic). When used in the latter sense, "axiom," "postulate", and "assumption" may be used interchangeably. In general, a non-logical axiom is not a self-evident truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory. To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms). There are typically multiple ways to axiomatize a given mathematical domain. Outside logic and mathematics, the term "axiom" is used loosely for any established principle of some field.

(axioma), a /wiki/Verbal_noun Verbal noun verbal noun from the verb ??????? (axioein), meaning "to deem worthy", but also "to require", which in turn comes from ????? (axios), meaning "being in balance", and hence "having (the same) value (as)", "worthy", "proper". Among the /wiki/Ancient_Greece Ancient Greece ancient Greek /wiki/Philosopher Philosopher philosophers an axiom was a claim which could be seen to be true without any need for proof. The root meaning of the word 'postulate' is to 'demand'; for instance, /wiki/Euclid Euclid Euclid demands of us that we agree that some things can be done, e.g. any two points can be joined by a straight line, etc. #cite_note-0 [1] Ancient geometers maintained some distinction between axioms and postulates. While commenting Euclid's books /wiki/Proclus Proclus Proclus remarks that " /wiki/Geminus Geminus Geminus held that this [4th] Postulate should not be classed as a postulate but as an axiom, since it does not, like the first three Postulates, assert the possibility of some construction but expresses an essential property". #cite_note-1 [2] /wiki/Boethius Boethius Boethius translated 'postulate' as petitio and called the axioms notiones communes but in later manuscripts this usage was not always strictly kept.

Axioms and postulates are the basic assumptions underlying a given body of deductive knowledge. They are accepted without demonstration. All other assertions ( /wiki/Theorem Theorem theorems, if we are talking about mathematics) must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions. However, the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern, and consequently the terms axiom and postulate hold a slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician, than they did for /wiki/Aristotle Aristotle Aristotle and /wiki/Euclid Euclid Euclid. The ancient Greeks considered /wiki/Geometry Geometry geometry as just one of several /wiki/Science Science sciences[ /wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed Wikipedia:Citation needed This claim needs references to reliable sources from August 2008 citation needed], and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts. As such, they developed and used the logico-deductive method as a means of avoiding error, and for structuring and communicating knowledge. Aristotle's /wiki/Posterior_analytics Posterior analytics posterior analytics is a definitive exposition of the classical view. An “axiom”, in classical terminology, referred to a self-evident assumption common to many branches of science. A good example would be the assertion that When an equal amount is taken from equals, an equal amount results. At the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses which were accepted without proof. Such a hypothesis was termed a postulate. While the axioms were common to many sciences, the postulates of each particular science were different. Their validity had to be established by means of real-world experience. Indeed, Aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated, if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates. #cite_note-2 [3] The classical approach is well illustrated by /wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements Euclid's Elements Euclid's Elements, where a list of postulates is given (common-sensical geometric facts drawn from our experience), followed by a list of "common notions" (very basic, self-evident assertions). Postulates It is possible to draw a /wiki/Straight_line Straight line straight line from any point to any other point. It is possible to extend a /wiki/Line_segment Line segment line segment continuously in a straight line. It is possible to describe a /wiki/Circle Circle circle with any center and any radius. It is true that all /wiki/Right_angle Right angle right angles are equal to one another. (" /wiki/Parallel_postulate Parallel postulate Parallel postulate") It is true that, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the /wiki/Polygon Polygon interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, /wiki/Line-line_intersection Line-line intersection intersect on that side on which are the /wiki/Angles Angles angles less than the two right angles. Common notions Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another. If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal. If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal. Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another. The whole is greater than the part. [ /w/index.php?title=Axiom&action=edit&section=4 Edit section: Modern development edit] Modern development A lesson learned by mathematics in the last 150 years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions (axioms, postulates, /wiki/Propositional_logic Propositional logic propositions, theorems) and definitions. One must concede the need for /wiki/Primitive_notion Primitive notion primitive notions, or undefined terms or concepts, in any study. Such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general, capable of multiple different meanings, and therefore useful in multiple contexts. /wiki/Alessandro_Padoa Alessandro Padoa Alessandro Padoa, /wiki/Mario_Pieri Mario Pieri Mario Pieri, and /wiki/Giuseppe_Peano Giuseppe Peano Giuseppe Peano were pioneers in this movement. Structuralist mathematics goes further, and develops theories and axioms (e.g. /wiki/Field_theory_(mathematics) Field theory (mathematics) field theory, /wiki/Group_(mathematics) Group (mathematics) group theory, /wiki/Topological_space Topological space topology, /wiki/Linear_space Linear space vector spaces) without any particular application in mind. The distinction between an “axiom” and a “postulate” disappears. The postulates of Euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts. The truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses. However, by throwing out Euclid's fifth postulate we get theories that have meaning in wider contexts, /wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry Hyperbolic geometry hyperbolic geometry for example. We must simply be prepared to use labels like “line” and “parallel” with greater flexibility. The development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that postulates should be regarded as purely formal statements, and not as facts based on experience. When mathematicians employ the /wiki/Field_(mathematics) Field (mathematics) field axioms, the intentions are even more abstract. The propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application; the mathematician now works in complete abstraction. There are many examples of fields; field theory gives correct knowledge about them all. It is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are “propositions that are regarded as true without proof.” Rather, the field axioms are a set of constraints. If any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints, then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system. Modern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects, and /wiki/Logic Logic logic itself can be regarded as a branch of mathematics. /wiki/Gottlob_Frege Gottlob Frege Frege, /wiki/Bertrand_Russell Bertrand Russell Russell, /wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 Henri Poincaré Poincaré, /wiki/David_Hilbert David Hilbert Hilbert, and /wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del Kurt Gödel Gödel are some of the key figures in this development. In the modern understanding, a set of axioms is any /wiki/Class_(set_theory) Class (set theory) collection of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow by the application of certain well-defined rules. In this view, logic becomes just another formal system. A set of axioms should be /wiki/Consistent Consistent consistent; it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axiom. A set of axioms should also be non-redundant; an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom. It was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics, perhaps all of mathematics, could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms. An early success of the formalist program was Hilbert's formalization of /wiki/Euclidean_geometry Euclidean geometry Euclidean geometry, and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms. In a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on /wiki/Georg_Cantor Georg Cantor Cantor's /wiki/Set_theory Set theory set theory. Here the emergence of /wiki/Russell%27s_paradox Russell's paradox Russell's paradox, and similar antinomies of /wiki/Na%C3%AFve_set_theory Naïve set theory naïve set theory raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent. The formalist project suffered a decisive setback, when in 1931 Gödel showed that it is possible, for any sufficiently large set of axioms ( /wiki/Peano_arithmetic Peano arithmetic Peano's axioms, for example) to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms. As a /wiki/Corollary Corollary corollary, Gödel proved that the consistency of a theory like /wiki/Peano_arithmetic Peano arithmetic Peano arithmetic is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory. It is reasonable to believe in the consistency of Peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of /wiki/Natural_number Natural number natural numbers, an /wiki/Infinite Infinite infinite but intuitively accessible formal system. However, at present, there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern /wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_axioms Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms for set theory. The /wiki/Axiom_of_choice Axiom of choice axiom of choice, a key hypothesis of this theory, remains a very controversial assumption. Furthermore, using techniques of /wiki/Forcing_(mathematics) Forcing (mathematics) forcing ( /wiki/Paul_Cohen_(mathematician) Paul Cohen (mathematician) Cohen) one can show that the /wiki/Continuum_hypothesis Continuum hypothesis continuum hypothesis (Cantor) is independent of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms. Thus, even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded as the definitive foundation for mathematics. [ /w/index.php?title=Axiom&action=edit&section=5 Edit section: Other sciences edit] Other sciences Axioms play a key role not only in mathematics, but also in other sciences, notably in /wiki/Theoretical_physics Theoretical physics theoretical physics. In particular, the monumental work of /wiki/Isaac_Newton Isaac Newton Isaac Newton is essentially based on /wiki/Euclid Euclid Euclid's axioms, augmented by a postulate on the non-relation of /wiki/Spacetime Spacetime spacetime and the physics taking place in it at any moment. In 1905, Newton's axioms were replaced by those of /wiki/Albert_Einstein Albert Einstein Albert Einstein's /wiki/Special_relativity Special relativity special relativity, and later on by those of /wiki/General_relativity General relativity general relativity. Another paper of Albert Einstein and coworkers (see /wiki/EPR_paradox EPR paradox EPR paradox), almost immediately contradicted by /wiki/Niels_Bohr Niels Bohr Niels Bohr, concerned the interpretation of /wiki/Quantum_mechanics Quantum mechanics quantum mechanics. This was in 1935. According to Bohr, this new theory should be /wiki/Probability_theory Probability theory probabilistic, whereas according to Einstein it should be /wiki/Deterministic Deterministic deterministic. Notably, the underlying quantum mechanical theory, i.e. the set of "theorems" derived by it, seemed to be identical. Einstein even assumed that it would be sufficient to add to quantum mechanics "hidden variables" to enforce determinism. However, thirty years later, in 1964, /wiki/John_Bell John Bell John Bell found a theorem, involving complicated optical correlations (see /wiki/Bell_inequalities Bell inequalities Bell inequalities), which yielded measurably different results using Einstein's axioms compared to using Bohr's axioms. And it took roughly another twenty years until an experiment of /wiki/Alain_Aspect Alain Aspect Alain Aspect got results in favour of Bohr's axioms, not Einstein's. (Bohr's axioms are simply: The theory should be probabilistic in the sense of the /wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation Copenhagen interpretation Copenhagen interpretation.) As a consequence, it is not necessary to explicitly cite Einstein's axioms, the more so since they concern subtle points on the "reality" and "locality" of experiments. Regardless, the role of axioms in mathematics and in the above-mentioned sciences is different. In mathematics one neither "proves" nor "disproves" an axiom for a set of theorems; the point is simply that in the conceptual realm identified by the axioms, the theorems logically follow. In contrast, in physics a comparison with experiments always makes sense, since a /wiki/Falsification Falsification falsified physical theory needs /wiki/Modification Modification modification. [ /w/index.php?title=Axiom&action=edit&section=6 Edit section: Mathematical logic edit] Mathematical logic In the field of /wiki/Mathematical_logic Mathematical logic mathematical logic, a clear distinction is made between two notions of axioms: logical and non-logical (somewhat similar to the ancient distinction between "axioms" and "postulates" respectively).

Each of these patterns is an /wiki/Axiom_schema Axiom schema axiom schema, a rule for generating an infinite number of axioms. For example, if A, B, and C are /wiki/Propositional_variable Propositional variable propositional variables, then A \to (B \to A) and (A \to \lnot B) \to (C \to (A \to \lnot B)) are both instances of axiom schema 1, and hence are axioms. It can be shown that with only these three axiom schemata and /wiki/Modus_ponens Modus ponens modus ponens, one can prove all tautologies of the propositional calculus. It can also be shown that no pair of these schemata is sufficient for proving all tautologies with modus ponens. Other axiom schemas involving the same or different sets of primitive connectives can be alternatively constructed. #cite_note-3 [4] These axiom schemata are also used in the /wiki/Predicate_calculus Predicate calculus predicate calculus, but additional logical axioms are needed to include a quantifier in the calculus. #cite_note-4 [5] [ /w/index.php?title=Axiom&action=edit&section=10 Edit section: Mathematical logic edit] Mathematical logic Axiom of Equality. Let \mathfrak{L}\, be a /wiki/First-order_language First-order language first-order language. For each variable x\, , the formula x = x\, is universally valid. This means that, for any /wiki/Free_variables_and_bound_variables Free variables and bound variables variable symbol x\,, the formula x = x\, can be regarded as an axiom. Also, in this example, for this not to fall into vagueness and a never-ending series of "primitive notions", either a precise notion of what we mean by x = x\, (or, for that matter, "to be equal") has to be well established first, or a purely formal and syntactical usage of the symbol =\, has to be enforced, only regarding it as a string and only a string of symbols, and mathematical logic does indeed do that. Another, more interesting example /wiki/Axiom_scheme Axiom scheme axiom scheme, is that which provides us with what is known as Universal Instantiation: Axiom scheme for Universal Instantiation. Given a formula \phi\, in a first-order language \mathfrak{L}\, , a variable x\, and a /wiki/First_order_logic#Terms First order logic term t\,\! that is /wiki/First-order_logic#Rules_of_inference First-order logic substitutable for x\, in \phi\, , the formula \forall x \, \phi \to \phi^x_t is universally valid. Where the symbol \phi^x_t stands for the formula \phi\, with the term t\,\! substituted for x\, . (See /wiki/Substitution_of_variables Substitution of variables Substitution of variables.) In informal terms, this example allows us to state that, if we know that a certain property P\, holds for every x\, and that t\,\! stands for a particular object in our structure, then we should be able to claim P(t)\, . Again, we are claiming that the formula \forall x \phi \to \phi^x_t is valid, that is, we must be able to give a "proof" of this fact, or more properly speaking, a metaproof. Actually, these examples are metatheorems of our theory of mathematical logic since we are dealing with the very concept of proof itself. Aside from this, we can also have Existential Generalization: Axiom scheme for Existential Generalization. Given a formula \phi\, in a first-order language \mathfrak{L}\, , a variable x\, and a term t\,\! that is substitutable for x\, in \phi\, , the formula \phi^x_t \to \exists x \, \phi is universally valid. [ /w/index.php?title=Axiom&action=edit&section=11 Edit section: Non-logical axioms edit] Non-logical axioms Non-logical axioms are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions. Reasoning about two different structures, for example the /wiki/Natural_number Natural number natural numbers and the /wiki/Integer Integer integers, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as /wiki/Group_(algebra) Group (algebra) groups). Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not /wiki/Tautology_(logic) Tautology (logic) tautologies. Another name for a non-logical axiom is postulate. #cite_note-5 [6] Almost every modern /wiki/Mathematical_theory Mathematical theory mathematical theory starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was thought[ /wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed Wikipedia:Citation needed This claim needs references to reliable sources from July 2011 citation needed] that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas. Non-logical axioms are often simply referred to as axioms in mathematical discourse. This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense. For example, in some groups, the group operation is /wiki/Commutative Commutative commutative, and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.

The idea that alternative mathematical systems might exist was very troubling to mathematicians of the 19th century and the developers of systems such as /wiki/Boolean_algebra_(logic) Boolean algebra (logic) Boolean algebra made elaborate efforts to derive them from traditional arithmetic. /wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois Évariste Galois Galois showed just before his untimely death that these efforts were largely wasted. Ultimately, the abstract parallels between algebraic systems were seen to be more important than the details and /wiki/Abstract_algebra Abstract algebra modern algebra was born. In the modern view axioms may be any set of formulas, as long as they are not known to be inconsistent.

Between the fifth and eighth centuries the Celtic-speaking communities of the Atlantic regions had emerged as a reasonably cohesive cultural entity. In language, religion, and art they shared a common heritage that distinguished them from the culture of surrounding polities. #cite_note-6 [7] The /wiki/Continental_Celtic_languages Continental Celtic languages Continental Celtic languages ceased to be widely used by the 6th century.

"Celti" or "Celtae") and the Greek (?????? pl. ?????? or ?????? pl. ??????) were borrowed from a native Celtic tribal name. #cite_note-10 [11] #cite_note-11 [12] /wiki/Pliny_the_Elder Pliny the Elder Pliny the Elder referred it as being used in /wiki/Lusitania Lusitania Lusitania as a tribal surname #cite_note-12 [13] which epigraphic findings confirm. #cite_note-13 [14] #cite_note-14 [15] Latin "Gallus" might originally be from a Celtic ethnic or /wiki/Tribal_name Tribal name tribal name, perhaps borrowed into Latin during the Celtic expansions into Italy of the early 5th century BC. Its root may be the /wiki/Proto-Celtic Proto-Celtic Common Celtic "*galno", meaning power or strength. Galli, /wiki/Gallaeci Gallaeci Gallaeci and Galatae most probably go with Old Irish gal 'boldness, ferocity' and Welsh gallu 'to be able, power'. #cite_note-15 [16] The Greek "Galatai" seems to be based on the same root, borrowed directly from the same hypothetical Celtic source which gave us "Galli" (the suffix "-atai" is an Ancient Greek inflection). #cite_note-16 [17] (see /wiki/Galatia Galatia Galatia in Anatolia) The English word "Celt" is modern, attested from 1707 in the writings of /wiki/Edward_Lhuyd Edward Lhuyd Edward Lhuyd whose work, along with that of other late 17th-century scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of these early inhabitants of Great Britain. #cite_note-17 [18] The English form "Gaul" (first recorded in the 17th century) and "Gaulish" come from the French "Gaule" and "Gaulois", which translate Latin "Gallia" and "Gallus, -icus" respectively. In Old French, the words "gualeis", "galois", "walois" (Northern French phonetics keeping /w/) had different meanings: Welsh or the /wiki/Langue_d%27o%C3%AFl Langue d'oïl Langue d'oïl, etc. On the other hand, the word "Waulle" (Northern French phonetics keeping /w/) is recorded for the first time in the 13th century to translate the Latin word Gallia, while "gaulois" is recorded for the first time in the 15th century, and the scholars use it to translate the Latin words Gallus / Gallicus. The word comes from Proto-Germanic *Walha- (see /wiki/Gaul#Name Gaul Gaul: Name). The English word "Welsh" originates from the word wælis?, the /wiki/Old_English_language Old English language Anglo-Saxon form of * /wiki/Walha Walha walhiska-, the reconstructed Proto-Germanic word for "foreign" #cite_note-18 [19] or "Celt" (South German //de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsche de:Welsche Welsch(e) "Celtic speaker", "French speaker", "Italian speaker"; Old Norse "valskr", pl. "valir" "Gaulish", "French"), that is supposed to be derived of the name of the " /wiki/Volcae Volcae Volcae", #cite_note-19 [20] a Celtic tribe who lived first in the South of Germany and emigrated then to Gaul. #cite_note-20 [21] The notion of an identifiable Celtic /wiki/Culture Culture cultural identity or "Celticity", though problematic, generally centres on language, art and classical texts, #cite_note-21 [22] though can also include, material artifacts, /wiki/Social_organisation Social organisation social organisation, /wiki/Homeland Homeland homeland and /wiki/Celtic_mythology Celtic mythology mythology. #cite_note-22 [23] Earlier theories were that this indicated a common racial origin but more recent theories are reflective of culture and language rather than race. Celtic cultures seem to have had numerous diverse characteristics but the commonality between these diverse peoples was the use of a Celtic language.[ /wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed Wikipedia:Citation needed This claim needs references to reliable sources from June 2010 citation needed]. "Celtic" is a descriptor of a /wiki/Language_family Language family family of languages and, more generally, means "of the Celts", or "in the style of the Celts". It has also been used to refer to several archaeological cultures defined by unique sets of artifacts. The link between language and artifact is aided by the presence of inscriptions. #cite_note-23 [24] (see /wiki/Celtic_(disambiguation) Celtic (disambiguation) Celtic (disambiguation) for other applications of the term) Today, the term Celtic is generally used to describe the languages and respective cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, /wiki/Cornwall Cornwall Cornwall, the /wiki/Isle_of_Man Isle of Man Isle of Man and /wiki/Brittany Brittany Brittany, also known as the /wiki/Celtic_nations Celtic nations Six Celtic Nations. These are the regions where four Celtic languages are still spoken to some extent as mother tongues: /wiki/Irish_language Irish language Irish Gaelic, /wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language Scottish Gaelic language Scottish Gaelic, /wiki/Welsh_language Welsh language Welsh, and /wiki/Breton_language Breton language Breton, plus two recent revivals, /wiki/Cornish_language Cornish language Cornish (one of the /wiki/Brythonic_languages Brythonic languages Brythonic languages) and /wiki/Manx_language Manx language Manx (one of the /wiki/Goidelic_languages Goidelic languages Goidelic languages). There are also attempts to reconstruct the /wiki/Cumbric_language Cumbric language Cumbric language (a Brythonic language from /wiki/North_West_England North West England Northwest England and Southwest Scotland). 'Celtic' is also sometimes used to describe regions of /wiki/Continental_Europe Continental Europe Continental Europe that claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language has survived; these areas include the western /wiki/Iberian_Peninsula Iberian Peninsula Iberian Peninsula, i.e. Portugal, and north-central Spain ( /wiki/Galicia_(Spain) Galicia (Spain) Galicia, /wiki/Asturias Asturias Asturias, /wiki/Cantabria Cantabria Cantabria, /wiki/Castile_and_Le%C3%B3n Castile and León Castile and León, /wiki/Extremadura Extremadura Extremadura). #cite_note-24 [25] (see /wiki/Modern_Celts Modern Celts Modern Celts) "Continental Celts" refers to the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe. "Insular Celts" refers to the different Celtic-speaking peoples of the British and Irish islands and to their descendants. The Celts of Brittany derive their language from migrating insular Celts mainly from Wales and /wiki/Cornwall Cornwall Cornwall and so are grouped accordingly. #cite_note-25 [26] Origins This article needs additional /wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#Inline_citations Wikipedia:Citing sources citations for /wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability Wikipedia:Verifiability verification.

The /wiki/Celtic_languages Celtic languages Celtic languages form a branch of the larger /wiki/Indo-European_family Indo-European family Indo-European family. By the time speakers of Celtic languages enter history around 400 BC, they were already split into several language groups, and spread over much of Western continental Europe, the /wiki/Iberian_Peninsula Iberian Peninsula Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Britain. Some scholars think that the /wiki/Urnfield Urnfield Urnfield culture of Western /wiki/Middle_Europe Middle Europe Middle Europe represents an origin for the Celts as a distinct cultural branch of the Indo-European family. #cite_note-ChadCorc-1 [2] This culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late /wiki/Bronze_Age Bronze Age Bronze Age, from /wiki/Circa Circa ca. 1200 BC until 700 BC, itself following the /wiki/Unetice_culture Unetice culture Unetice and /wiki/Tumulus_cultures Tumulus cultures Tumulus cultures. The Urnfield period saw a dramatic increase in population in the region, probably due to innovations in technology and /wiki/Agriculture Agriculture agricultural practices. The Greek historian /wiki/Ephorus Ephorus Ephoros of Cyme in /wiki/Asia_Minor Asia Minor Asia Minor, writing in the 4th century BC, believed that the Celts came from the islands off the mouth of the /wiki/Rhine Rhine Rhine and were "driven from their homes by the frequency of wars and the violent rising of the sea". The spread of /wiki/Iron_Age Iron Age iron-working led to the development of the /wiki/Hallstatt_culture Hallstatt culture Hallstatt culture directly from the Urnfield ( /wiki/Circa Circa ca. 700 to 500 BC). /wiki/Proto-Celtic Proto-Celtic Proto-Celtic, the latest /wiki/Common_descent Common descent common ancestor of all known Celtic languages, is considered by this school of thought to have been spoken at the time of the late Urnfield or early Hallstatt cultures, in the early 1st millennium BC. The spread of the Celtic languages to Iberia, Ireland and Britain would have occurred during the first half of the 1st millennium BC, the earliest /wiki/Chariot_burial Chariot burial chariot burials in Britain dating to c. 500 BC. Other scholars see Celtic languages as covering Britain and Ireland, and parts of the Continent, long before any evidence of "Celtic" culture is found in archaeology. Over the centuries the language(s) developed into the separate /wiki/Celtiberian_language Celtiberian language Celtiberian, Goidelic and /wiki/Brythonic_languages Brythonic languages Brythonic languages. The Hallstatt culture was succeeded by the /wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne La Tène La Tène culture of central Europe, which was overrun by the Roman Empire, though traces of La Tène style are still to be seen in /wiki/Gallo-Roman Gallo-Roman Gallo-Roman artefacts. In Britain and Ireland La Tène style in art survived precariously to re-emerge in /wiki/Insular_art Insular art Insular art. Early /wiki/Irish_literature Irish literature Irish literature casts light on the flavour and tradition of the heroic warrior elites who dominated Celtic societies. Celtic river-names are found in great numbers around the upper reaches of /wiki/Danube Danube the Danube and Rhine, which led many Celtic scholars to place the /wiki/Ethnogenesis Ethnogenesis ethnogenesis of the Celts in this area. /wiki/Diodorus_Siculus Diodorus Siculus Diodorus Siculus and /wiki/Strabo Strabo Strabo both suggest that the Celtic heartland was in /wiki/Southern_France Southern France southern France. The former says that the Gauls were to the north of the Celts but that the Romans referred to both as Gauls. Before the discoveries at Hallstatt and La Tene, it was generally considered that the Celtic heartland was southern France, see /wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica Encyclopædia Britannica Encyclopædia Britannica for 1813.

This view was challenged by Jubainville[ /wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed Wikipedia:Citation needed This claim needs references to reliable sources from November 2011 citation needed] who placed the land of origin of the Celts east of the Rhine. Jubainville based his arguments on a phrase of Herodotus´ that placed the Celts at the source of the Danube, and argued that Herodotus had meant to place the Celtic homeland in southern Germany. The finding of the prehistoric cemetery of Hallstat in 1846 by Johan Ramsauer and almost ten years later the finding of the archaeological site of La Tène by Hansli Kopp in 1857 draw attention to this area. The concept that the Hallstatt and La Tene cultures could be seen not just as chronological periods but as “Culture Groups”, entities composed of people of the same ethnicity and language, started to grow by the end of the 19th century. In the beginning of the 20th century the belief that those “Culture Groups” could be thought in racial or ethnic terms was strongly held by /wiki/Gordon_Childe Gordon Childe Gordon Childe whose theory was influenced by the writings of /wiki/Gustaf_Kossinna Gustaf Kossinna Gustaf Kossinna. #cite_note-27 [28] Along the 20th century the racial ethnic interpretation of La Tene culture rooted much stronger, and any findings of “La Tene culture” and “flat inhumation cemeteries” were directly associated with the celts and the celtic language. #cite_note-28 [29] The Iron Age /wiki/Hallstatt_culture Hallstatt culture Hallstatt (c. 800-475 BC) and /wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture La Tène culture La Tène (c. 500-50 BC) cultures are typically associated with Proto-Celtic and Celtic culture. #cite_note-29 [30] In various[ /wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify Wikipedia:Please clarify The text in the vicinity of this tag needs clarification or removal of jargon from July 2010 clarification needed] /wiki/List_of_academic_disciplines List of academic disciplines academic disciplines the Celts were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon, through the cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. However, archaeological finds from the Halstatt and La Tène culture were rare in the Iberian Peninsula, in southwestern France, northern and western Britain, southern Ireland and Galatia #cite_note-30 [31] #cite_note-31 [32] and did not provide enough evidence for a cultural scenario comparable to that of Central Europe. It is considered equally difficult to maintain that the origin of the Peninsular Celts can be linked to the preceding Urnfield culture, leading to a more recent approach that introduces a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation having its initial roots in the Bronze Age /wiki/Beaker_culture Beaker culture Bell Beaker culture. #cite_note-Lorrio-32 [33] /wiki/File:Celts_in_III_century_BC.jpg /wiki/File:Celts_in_III_century_BC.jpg Enlarge Expansion of the Celtic culture in the IIIth century BC according to Francisco Villar in The /wiki/Indo-Europeans Indo-Europeans Indo-Europeans and the origins of Europe - Italian version p.446 The La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) in eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, southwest Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. It developed out of the Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from /wiki/Ancient_Greece Ancient Greece Greek, and later /wiki/Etruscan_civilisation Etruscan civilisation Etruscan civilisations. A shift of settlement centres took place in the 4th century. The western La Tène culture corresponds to historical /wiki/Gaul Gaul Celtic Gaul. Whether this means that the whole of La Tène culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language, material culture, and /wiki/Political_party Political party political affiliation do not necessarily run parallel. Frey notes that in the 5th century, "burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions". #cite_note-33 [34] Thus, while the La Tène culture is certainly associated with the /wiki/Gauls Gauls Gauls, the presence of La Tène artefacts may be due to cultural contact and does not imply the permanent presence of Celtic speakers. Historical evidence /wiki/Polybius Polybius Polybius published a /wiki/History_of_Rome History of Rome history of Rome about 150 BC in which he describes the Gauls of Italy and their conflict with Rome. /wiki/Pausanias_(geographer) Pausanias (geographer) Pausanias in the 2nd century BC says that the Gauls "originally called Celts", "live on the remotest region of Europe on the coast of an enormous tidal sea". /wiki/Posidonius Posidonius Posidonius described the southern Gauls about 100 BC. Though his original work is lost it was used by later writers such as /wiki/Strabo Strabo Strabo. The latter, writing in the early 1st century AD, deals with Britain and Gaul as well as Hispania, Italy and Galatia. /wiki/Julius_Caesar Julius Caesar Caesar wrote extensively about his /wiki/Commentarii_de_Bello_Gallico Commentarii de Bello Gallico Gallic Wars in 58-51 BC. /wiki/Diodorus_Siculus Diodorus Siculus Diodorus Siculus wrote about the Celts of Gaul and Britain in his 1st-century history. Minority views /wiki/Mart%C3%ADn_Almagro_Gorbea Martín Almagro Gorbea Martín Almagro Gorbea #cite_note-34 [35] proposed the origins of the Celts could be traced back to the 3rd millennium BC, seeking the initial roots in the /wiki/Beaker_culture Beaker culture Bell Beaker culture, thus offering the wide dispersion of the Celts throughout /wiki/Western_Europe Western Europe western Europe, as well as the variability of the different Celtic peoples, and the existence of ancestral traditions an ancient perspective. More recently, John Koch #cite_note-Koch2009-35 [36] and /wiki/Barry_Cunliffe Barry Cunliffe Barry Cunliffe #cite_note-36 [37] have suggested that Celtic origins lie with the /wiki/Atlantic_Bronze_Age Atlantic Bronze Age Atlantic Bronze Age, roughly contemporaneous with the Hallstatt culture but positioned considerably to the West, extending along the Atlantic coast of Europe. /wiki/Stephen_Oppenheimer Stephen Oppenheimer Stephen Oppenheimer #cite_note-37 [38] points out that Herodotus seemed to believe the Danube rose near the /wiki/Pyrenees Pyrenees Pyrenees.

Their descendants were described by Julius Caesar in his /wiki/Gallic_Wars Gallic Wars Gallic Wars. Eastern Gaul was the centre of the western La Tène culture. In later Iron Age Gaul, the social organisation was similar to that of the Romans, with large towns. From the 3rd century BC the Gauls adopted coinage, and texts with Greek characters are known in southern Gaul from the 2nd century. Greek traders founded Massalia in about 600 BC, with exchange up the /wiki/Rh%C3%B4ne_River Rhône River Rhone valley, but trade was disrupted soon after 500 BC and re-oriented over the Alps to the Po valley in Italy. /wiki/Roman_Empire Roman Empire The Romans arrived in the Rhone valley in the 2nd century BC and encountered a Gaul that was mostly Celtic-speaking. Rome needed land communications with its Iberian provinces and fought a major battle with the Saluvii at Entremont in 124-123 BC. Gradually Roman control extended, and the /wiki/Roman_province Roman province Roman Province of /wiki/Gallia_Narbonensis Gallia Narbonensis Gallia Transalpina was formed along the Mediterranean coast. The remainder was known as Gallia Comata - "Hairy Gaul". In 58 BC, the Helvetii planned to migrate westward but were forced back by Julius Caesar. He then became involved in fighting the various tribes in Gaul, and by 55 BC, most of Gaul had been overrun. In 52 BC, /wiki/Vercingetorix Vercingetorix Vercingetorix led a revolt against the Roman occupation but was defeated at the siege of Alesia and surrendered. Following the Gallic Wars of 58-51 BC, Caesar's Celtica formed the main part of Roman Gaul. This territory of the Celtic tribes was bounded on the south by the Garonne and on the north by the Seine and the Marne. #cite_note-38 [39] Place and personal name analysis and inscriptions suggest that the Gaulish Celtic language was spoken over most of what is now France. #cite_note-39 [40] Iberia /wiki/File:Iberia_300BC.svg /wiki/File:Iberia_300BC.svg Enlarge Main language areas in /wiki/Iberian_Peninsula Iberian Peninsula Iberia, showing Celtic languages in /wiki/Beige Beige beige, circa 300 BC. /wiki/File:Torque_de_Santa_Tegra_1.JPG /wiki/File:Torque_de_Santa_Tegra_1.JPG Enlarge Triskelion and spirals on a Galician torc terminal (Museu do castro de Santa Tegra).

However, since according to the definition of the /wiki/Iron_Age Iron Age Iron Age in the 19th century Celtic populations were supposedly rare in Iberia and did not provide a cultural scenario that could easily be linked to that of Central Europe, the presence of celtic culture in that region was generally not fully recognised. Three divisions of the Celts of the Iberian Peninsula were assumed to have existed: the /wiki/Celtiberians Celtiberians Celtiberians in the mountains near the centre of the peninsula, the /wiki/Celtici Celtici Celtici in the southwest, and the celts in the northwest (in /wiki/Gallaecia Gallaecia Gallaecia and /wiki/Asturias Asturias Asturias). #cite_note-42 [43] Modern scholarship, however, has clearly proven that Celtic presence and influences were most substantial in what is today Spain and Portugal (with perhaps the highest settlement saturation in Western Europe), particularly in the central, western and northern regions. #cite_note-Quintela-43 [44] #cite_note-44 [45] The Celts in Iberia were divided into two main archaeological and cultural groups, #cite_note-45 [46] even though that division is not very clear: One group was spread out along /wiki/Galicia_(Spain) Galicia (Spain) Galicia #cite_note-46 [47] and the Iberian /wiki/Atlantic_Europe Atlantic Europe Atlantic shores.

The origins of the Celtiberians might provide a key to understanding the Celticisation process in the rest of the Peninsula. The process of Celticisation of the southwestern area of the peninsula by the Keltoi and of the northwestern area is, however, not a simple Celtiberian question. Recent investigations about the /wiki/Gallaeci Gallaeci Callaici #cite_note-52 [53] and /wiki/Bracari Bracari Bracari #cite_note-53 [54] in northwestern Portugal are providing new approaches to understanding Celtic culture (language, art and religion) in western Iberia. #cite_note-54 [55] John T.

Linguists have been arguing for many years whether a Celtic language came to Britain and Ireland and then split or whether there were two separate "invasions".

This was due partly to the relative sparcity of mines and the amount of effort needed for extraction compared to the profit gained. As the Roman civilisation grew in importance and expanded its trade with the Celtic world, silver and bronze coinage became more common. This coincided with a major increase in gold production in Celtic areas to meet the Roman demand, due to the high value Romans put on the metal.

D. Rankin in Celts and the Classical World notes that "Athenaeus echoes this comment (603a) and so does /wiki/Ammianus_Marcellinus Ammianus Marcellinus Ammianus (30.9). It seems to be the general opinion of antiquity." #cite_note-71 [72] In book XIII of his /wiki/Deipnosophistae Deipnosophistae Deipnosophists, the Roman Greek rhetorician and grammarian /wiki/Athenaeus Athenaeus Athenaeus, repeating assertions made by /wiki/Diodorus_Siculus Diodorus Siculus Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC ( /wiki/Bibliotheca_historica Bibliotheca historica Bibliotheca historica 5:32), wrote that Celtic women were beautiful but that the men preferred to sleep together. Diodorus went further, stating that "the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused". Rankin argues that the ultimate source of these assertions is likely to be /wiki/Poseidonius Poseidonius Poseidonius and speculates that these authors may be recording male "bonding rituals". #cite_note-72 [73] The /wiki/Sexual_norm Sexual norm sexual freedom of women in Britain was noted by /wiki/Cassius_Dio Cassius Dio Cassius Dio: #cite_note-Dio_Cassius-73 [74] ...a very witty remark is reported to have been made by the wife of Argentocoxus, a Caledonian, to /wiki/Livia Livia Julia Augusta. When the empress was jesting with her, after the treaty, about the free intercourse of her sex with men in Britain, she replied: "We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest." Such was the retort of the British woman. — /wiki/Cassius_Dio Cassius Dio Cassius Dio There are instances recorded where women participated both in warfare and in kingship, although they were in the minority in these areas. /wiki/Plutarch Plutarch Plutarch reports that Celtic women acted as ambassadors to avoid a war among Celts chiefdoms in the Po valley during the 4th century BC. #cite_note-Ellis-74 [75] Very few reliable sources exist regarding Celtic views towards gender divisions and societal statues, though some archaeological evidence does suggest that their views towards /wiki/Gender_role Gender role gender roles may differ from contemporary and less /wiki/Egalitarian Egalitarian egalitarian classical counterparts of the roman era. #cite_note-75 [76] #cite_note-76 [77] There are some general indications from Iron Age burial sites in the Champagne and Bourgogne regions of Northeastern France which suggest that women may have had roles in combat during the earlier portions of the La Tène period. However, the evidence is far from conclusive. #cite_note-77 [78] Examples of individuals buried with both female jewellery and weaponry have been identified, such as the /wiki/Vix_Grave Vix Grave Vix Grave, and there are questions about the sexing of some skeletons that were buried with warrior assemblages. However, it has been suggested that "the weapons may indicate rank instead of masculinity". #cite_note-78 [79] Among the insular Celts, there is a greater amount of historic documentation to suggest warrior roles for women. In addition to commentary by /wiki/Tacitus Tacitus Tacitus about /wiki/Boudica Boudica Boudica, there are indications from later period histories that also suggest a more substantial role for "women as warriors" in symbolic if not actual roles. /wiki/Posidonius Posidonius Posidonius and /wiki/Strabo Strabo Strabo described an island of women where men could not venture for fear of death, and where the women ripped each other apart. #cite_note-79 [80] Other writers, such as /wiki/Ammianus_Marcellinus Ammianus Marcellinus Ammianus Marcellinus and /wiki/Tacitus Tacitus Tacitus, mentioned Celtic women inciting, participating in, and leading battles. #cite_note-80 [81] Poseidonius' anthropological comments on the Celts had common themes, primarily /wiki/Primitivism Primitivism primitivism, extreme ferocity, cruel sacrificial practices, and the strength and courage of their women. #cite_note-81 [82] Under /wiki/Early_Irish_law Early Irish law Brehon Law, which was written down in /wiki/Early_Middle_Ages Early Middle Ages early Medieval Ireland after /wiki/Conversion_to_Christianity Conversion to Christianity conversion to Christianity, a woman had the right to divorce her husband and gain his property if he was unable to perform his marital duties due to impotence, obesity, homosexual inclination or preference for other women. #cite_note-C.C3.A1in_L.C3.A1namna_.28Couples_Law.29-82 [83] Celtic art /wiki/File:Romano-Celtic_mirror_(Desborough).jpg /wiki/File:Romano-Celtic_mirror_(Desborough).jpg Enlarge The reverse side of a British bronze mirror, with spiral and trumpet motifs typical of La Tène Celtic art in Britain Main article: /wiki/Celtic_art Celtic art Celtic art Celtic art is generally used by art historians to refer to art of the La Tène period across Europe, while the /wiki/Early_Medieval Early Medieval Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, that is what "Celtic art" evokes for much of the general public, is called /wiki/Insular_art Insular art Insular art in art history.

In contrast the less well known but often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other "foreign" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic.

Rites and sacrifices were carried out by priests known as /wiki/Druid Druid druids. The Celts did not see their gods as having human shapes until late in the Iron Age. Celtic /wiki/Shrine Shrine shrines were situated in remote areas such as hilltops, groves, and lakes. Celtic religious patterns were regionally variable; however, some patterns of deity forms, and ways of worshipping these deities, appeared over a wide geographical and temporal range. The Celts worshipped both gods and goddesses. In general, Celtic gods were deities of particular skills, such as the many-skilled /wiki/Lugh Lugh Lugh and /wiki/The_Dagda The Dagda Dagda, while goddesses were associated with natural features, particularly rivers (such as /wiki/Boann Boann Boann, goddess of the /wiki/River_Boyne River Boyne River Boyne). This was not universal, however, as goddesses such as /wiki/Brigid Brigid Brighid and /wiki/Morr%C3%ADgan Morrígan The Morrígan were associated with both natural features ( /wiki/Clootie_well Clootie well holy wells and the River Unius) and skills such as blacksmithing and healing. #cite_note-Sjoestedt-92 [93] Triplicity is a common theme in Celtic cosmology, and a number of deities were seen as threefold. #cite_note-Sjoestedt2-93 [94] This trait is exhibited by The Three Mothers, a group of goddesses worshipped by many Celtic tribes (with regional variations). #cite_note-Inse_Jones_1995-94 [95] The Celts had literally hundreds of deities, some of which were unknown outside a single family or tribe, while others were popular enough to have a following that crossed lingual and cultural barriers. For instance, the Irish god Lugh, associated with /wiki/Storm Storm storms, /wiki/Lightning Lightning lightning, and culture, is seen in similar forms as /wiki/Lugos Lugos Lugos in Gaul and /wiki/Lleu Lleu Lleu in Wales. Similar patterns are also seen with the continental Celtic horse goddess /wiki/Epona Epona Epona and what may well be her Irish and Welsh counterparts, /wiki/Macha_(Irish_mythology) Macha (Irish mythology) Macha and /wiki/Rhiannon Rhiannon Rhiannon, respectively. #cite_note-Sjoestedt3-95 [96] Roman reports of the druids mention ceremonies being held in /wiki/Sacred_grove Sacred grove sacred groves.

Druids organised and ran religious ceremonies, and they memorised and taught the /wiki/Celtic_calendar Celtic calendar calendar. Other classes of druids performed ceremonial sacrifices of crops and /wiki/Animal_sacrifice Animal sacrifice animals for the perceived benefit of the community. #cite_note-Sjoestedt5-96 [97] Gallic Calendar Main article: /wiki/Coligny_calendar Coligny calendar Coligny calendar The /wiki/Coligny_calendar Coligny calendar Coligny calendar, which was found in 1897 in /wiki/Coligny,_Ain Coligny, Ain Coligny, /wiki/Ain Ain Ain, was engraved on a /wiki/Bronze Bronze bronze tablet, preserved in 73 fragments, that originally was 1.48 m wide and 0.9 m high (Lambert p. 111).

The restored tablet contains 16 vertical columns, with 62 months distributed over 5 years. The French archaeologist J. Monard speculated that it was recorded by /wiki/Druid Druid druids wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the /wiki/Julian_calendar Julian calendar Julian calendar was imposed throughout the /wiki/Roman_Empire Roman Empire Roman Empire. However, the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars (or parapegmata) found throughout the Greek and Roman world. #cite_note-98 [99] Roman Influence Further information: /wiki/Gallo-Roman_culture Gallo-Roman culture Gallo-Roman culture The Roman invasion of Gaul brought a great deal of Celtic peoples into the Roman Empire. Roman culture had a profound effect on the Celtic tribes which came under the empire's control. Roman influence led to many changes in Celtic religion, the most noticeable of which was the weakening of the druid class, especially religiously; the druids were to eventually disappear altogether. Romano-Celtic deities also began to appear: these deities often had both Roman and Celtic attributes and combined the names of Roman and Celtic deities. Other changes included the adaptation of the /w/index.php?title=Jupiter_Pole&action=edit&redlink=1 Jupiter Pole (page does not exist) Jupiter Pole, a sacred pole which was used throughout Celtic regions of the empire, primarily in the north. Another major change in religious practice was the use of stone monuments to represent gods and goddesses. The Celts had only created wooden idols (including monuments carved into trees, which were known as sacred poles) previously to Roman conquest. #cite_note-Inse_Jones_1995-94 [95] Celtic Christianity Main article: /wiki/Celtic_Christianity Celtic Christianity Celtic Christianity /wiki/File:Ccross.svg /wiki/File:Ccross.svg Enlarge A /wiki/Celtic_cross Celtic cross Celtic cross.
